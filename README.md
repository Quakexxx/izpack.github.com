# IzPack website

Source code for the [IzPack public website](http://izpack.org/).

**Current status**: in development of a new version of [http://izpack.org/](http://izpack.org/).

Things to keep in mind:

* Pick a license.
* GitHub commit integration with the scm mailing-list (seems like it's not working easily).
* Google Analytics integration.
