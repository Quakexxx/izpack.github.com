<PRE>Hi all,

I have committed a few fixes adviced by running a IntelliJ IDEA code
inspection. There are many other issues that it pointed out, but they
require more thinking, and sometimes I was not the author of the files,
hence I did not touch it if I wasn't feeling confident enough.

I have been evaluating IDEA and I have a few days left. Jetbrains offers
annual licenses for F/OSS projects, maybe we could apply for it. Of course
IDEA is not F/OSS, but it is already used by many projects in the Java
F/OSS community (Apache, Codehaus, ...). This does not mean that other
IDEs are any bad (I personnaly use Eclipse and Netbeans indifferently
depending on what I am doing). Just let me know.

Cheers


</PRE>
