I think there was no need for it.  I looked at several panels that used 
it.  I even hesitated to create my AlteredPathSelectionPanel, because I 
was hesitant to change the behavior of something used in other places, 
but then I realize the change I was making to the JFileChooser was not 
something that would confuse an end user.

Thanks, Klaus.  I hope my new panels (and something interesting Fabrice 
and I have been doing) will make up for me being such a pest.  IzPack's 
a nifty piece of work and it would be great if my work can help it out.

Hal
