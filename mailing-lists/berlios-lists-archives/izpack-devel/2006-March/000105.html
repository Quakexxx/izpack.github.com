<PRE>This is basically a curiosity thing, but I've noticed that in pretty 
much every class I've looked at in IzPack, the imports are very 
specific, like:

import javax.swing.JButton;

instead of something like:

import javax.swing.*;

which is what I've seen in most examples in tutorials and howto 
articles, including many demos and examples on Sun's own Java sites.

Is there a reason for such specific imports in IzPack?  I ran a few 
tests on a class or two of my own, and there doesn't seem to be any 
difference in class size.  The compile time difference, at least on my 
tests, was within a normal variance, allowing for different test runs 
and different results within each run.

It's not a critical question, but I was just wondering what the 
reasoning was for this or if it's just one coder's habit that has 
caught on.
