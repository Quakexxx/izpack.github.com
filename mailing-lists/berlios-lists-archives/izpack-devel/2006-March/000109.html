I can't see a reason that information would be used, either, but one 
thing I've noticed and like about Eclipse is that it is good about 
showing which imports and variables are never used.  That makes it 
easy, when you're done, to clean up the list of imports.

I did just find a glitch in this feature in Eclipse, though.  I have a 
main(String[] args) method that sets 3 variables from the arguments 
passed from the command line and uses them once, to construct the class 
before calling a method in it.  Eclipse keeps flagging those variables 
as unused when they are used.  Guess everything has a bug in it.
