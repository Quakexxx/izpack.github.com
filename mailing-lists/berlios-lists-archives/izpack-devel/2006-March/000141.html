It's probably my fault on that.  My thinking was that most applications 
that need settings like that changed or edited will have some kind of 
control or preferences panel to select the printer, and would often 
allow the printer to be set later.

Sometimes when you're installing a program that uses a printer, you want 
to be able to test the printer during the install process.  That was 
the whole reason I did the original SelectPrinterPanel.  That way, when 
the end user installs a program, a printer is already selected and they 
don't have to do additional work beyond the initial install.

All SelectPrinterPanel does (at this point, Fabrice has some cool 
improvements on it) is to let the end user pick a printer for the 
application and to store the name of that printer in the IzPack 
variable $SELECTED_PRINTER for use in parsed files used either during 
the ProcessPanel activities or later.

The version of SelectPrinterPanel that we're working on (which may or 
may not make its way into IzPack) will also let the end user print a 
test page or click a checkbox to say they want the printer tested on 
install.  But that's a future possibility, not a present feature.
