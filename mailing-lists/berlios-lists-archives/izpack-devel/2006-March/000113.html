I can understand that.  What surprises me, though, is that I never saw 
it done in any of the books I learned Java from and it is rarely done 
in tutorials, examples, and articles.  Seems many people are getting 
lazy.

Actually, this is one of the habits working on custom panels and such 
for IzPack has gotten me used to.

&gt;<i> The 
</I>&gt;<i> thing is that you can always start with a star import, and ask your
</I>&gt;<i> favorite IDE to replace it with only the required imports. 
</I>
I didn't realize that was a feature.  I'm self taught (but used to 
program in 6502 Assembler back in the 1980s), and for 3-4 years, my 
idea of an IDE was Kate, a text editor in KDE that has a text window, a 
file list window, and a console, so I had the console and text in the 
same window.  I'm still blown away by all the toys Eclipse has.

I just found the feature to do what you're talking about.  So now I can 
just use * for my imports and let Eclipse figure it out from there.  I 
like letting the computer do my work!

&gt;<i> Except 
</I>&gt;<i> that it makes your dependencies explicit, I think I read once that it
</I>&gt;<i> speeds-up the compilation, but I am really not sure that (1) it is
</I>&gt;<i> significant, and (2) that it is actually the case :-)
</I>
I'd have to agree that if it is the case, it isn't significant, at least 
in the few tests I ran.
