<PRE>Hi all,

I have contacted JetBrains about an Open Source License for IzPack. I  
will soon receive the key, and interested developers can contact me  
to obtain it. As you can see from the email extract below, JetBrains  
is very fair and does not put insane restrictions.

I would like to thank JetBrains for supporting IzPack and other F/OSS  
projects!

Cheers






 &gt; I am the original developer and maintainer of the IzPack project
 &gt; (<A HREF="http://www.izforge.com/izpack/">http://www.izforge.com/izpack/</A>). A few developers and I have been
 &gt; trying IDEA lately, and we've found it to be powerful. We are
 &gt; interested to apply for an Open Source License for the project.

Thank you for your interest in our product!

Your project seems to meet our requirements. Great! :)

 &gt; I have read the license and found it to be very fair, but I have a  
few
 &gt; questions about Jetbrains policy with Open Source licensee. The
 &gt; following points have been raised in our discussions on wether to
 &gt; apply for an IDEA license or not.
 &gt; - Do you require further advertising from projects? We would see no
 &gt; objections to put a logo on our pages and thank Jetbrains of course.

It would be great if you could display one of our logos on your  
project's
site page and link it to our website. However, this is absolutely not
required. This is a no-strings-attached license.

 &gt; - Does the license allow to work only for the given project, or is it
 &gt; possible to work on other Open Source projects with it as well?

You will receive one common key, which you are eligible to distribute  
only
among the developers involved in the registered project. It is clear  
that
you and your work-mate can use it to work on other Open Source  
projects as
well.

 &gt; - We are strongly commited to supporting the diversity in the IDE
 &gt; space. Hence, we would not want to favor IDEA over Eclipse over
 &gt; Netbeans and so on. Do you have any objection with that?

Certainly not! Favour to one or another IDE is just a matter of comfort,
customs, tastes, and many-many other things so we don't expect our  
users to
be funs or evangelists, therefore we don't have any objections of  
this kind.

 &gt; - Some developers happen contribute from their workplaces, would they
 &gt; be allowed to install IDEA for the sole purpose of working on IzPack?

If I understand you correctly, the key you will receive is a key,  
which can
work even on computers, linked to one network, simultaneously. So we  
don't
any &quot;topological&quot; restrictions.
