The problem with that is the panel needs text in IzPack, but the 
developer can use the printer for anything.  The idea was to keep the 
wording broad enough so it didn't force the developer to use the 
printer for only one purpose.  It is possible to create a custom 
language pack, though, and I believe (ask a developer for sure) that 
any string you put in the custom lang pack for 
SelectPrinterPanel.select_printer should override what is there.

There's also the chance, if the newer version is adopted, that this text 
could be changed to work with the changes.
