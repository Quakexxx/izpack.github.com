Fabrice and I have been working on a project since January that solves a 
major part of this problem.  Julien is aware of it and I've mentioned 
it here.  We add one extra XML file that can be used by any panel that 
wants it.  The name of the file is specified in the resources section 
and we have classes that read and parse the file so any panel using it 
just has to ask for a variable.  It also allows things like multiple 
InfoPanels and HTMLInfoPanels.

I just have to review a couple things before I send all I have now back 
to Fabrice, who will be reviewing it before it is posted here.
