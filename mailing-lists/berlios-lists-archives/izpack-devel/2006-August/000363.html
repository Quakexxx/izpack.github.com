</I>&gt;<i>Subject: [izpack-devel] Proposed new changes
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Hello folks,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I've made a number of changes that I would like to contribute back to
</I>&gt;<i>IzPack.  I'm sending them to you to see if anybody has any 
</I>&gt;<i>objections to
</I>&gt;<i>them:
</I>&gt;<i>* I've changed the TableModel for the PacksPanel so that the
</I>&gt;<i>dependencies work both ways.  Assume that you have packs A and B, where
</I>&gt;<i>A depends on B.  Currently if you click on A it won't allow 
</I>&gt;<i>itself to be
</I>&gt;<i>checked until B is checked.  I've changed it so that if you click on A
</I>&gt;<i>then B will be checked automatically.  I would like to make this an
</I>&gt;<i>option whether you want this functionality or the original
</I>&gt;<i>functionality.  I'm proposing that this functionality be the default.
</I>
If possible, changes or extension should be compatible to the old 
behavior. That's what you will do, good.
I am not happy with the current behavior, but until jet it was tolerable
for me.
What about A and C depends on B? Means you need B if you would install
A and/or C. That's my situation. Do you have an Idee to handle it with 
your changed behavior?
An other point with which I am not so happy: The description area uses
an other font as the rest. Should be peanuts, but until jet a have had
no time for it. 

&gt;<i>  * I've created a much, much more complex, but also nicer InstallPanel
</I>&gt;<i>that has pretty checkmarks and shows the status of the install on the
</I>&gt;<i>left while files are being copied and the ant tasks are running.  Our
</I>&gt;<i>install is really complicated - containing about 1.2 GB of software.
</I>&gt;<i>We've integrated a number of third party applications to our 
</I>&gt;<i>application
</I>&gt;<i>that need to be configured individually.  I'd like to offer an
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;AdvancedInstallPanel&quot; that handles some of these more complex
</I>&gt;<i>scenarios.
</I>
Sounds like you support also custom actions as the &quot;ExtendedInstallPanel&quot;
(you ask about ant tasks). That will be a precondition for me to use it
in my installation.
If you read this mailing list, you know that I am just at changing 
layout of IzPanels. The &quot;full area using&quot; panels like the PacksPanel are
not affected, but the InstallPanel. I do it because the standard layouts
makes problems for me e.g. at a back step (sometimes the layout will be
changed). Additional I need panels where the anchor is NORTHWEST; the 
standared in IzPack is CENTER.
If your panel uses not allways the full panel area, it should also use 
the new layout. Unfortunately I am just during changing and there is also 
no docu in the moment. I hope I can checkin this week the first changed
panels which then can be used as example.

&gt;<i>  * I'd like to fix a number of IzPack bugs related to installing more
</I>&gt;<i>than 2GB of software.  Currently IzPack uses integers to pass 
</I>&gt;<i>around the
</I>&gt;<i>size of modules/disk space where we need to use longs.  As I'm 
</I>&gt;<i>sure most
</I>&gt;<i>of you know, integerss can't be used to calculate spaces for more than
</I>&gt;<i>2GB.  Fixing this will also allow you to see the real size of the disk
</I>&gt;<i>space available.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Your calculation of space changes are checked in by Julien.

Are you capable to create and handle a jar file greater than 2 GB with
a standard 1.4.x VM? I never tested it, but I rember that there was 
a problem earlier...


&gt;<i>Any comments?  Suggestions?  Opposition?
