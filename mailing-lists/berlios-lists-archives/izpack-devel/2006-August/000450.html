&gt;<i> IIRC, IzPack still supports Java 1.2. Therefore we cannot introduce 1.4
</I>&gt;<i> depencies.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
Might not be the right way to go, but something to consider:  What if we 
use java.util.Logging from 1.4/1.5 and just compile an external jar with 
those classes for distribution with earlier version of JDK if it is 
used? That way, when IZPack eventually moves to a v1.4 requirement, we 
are already using the built in logging.

I know this is possibly over complicating things, and I don't know if 
the JRE license will allow that, But I really prefer the idea of having 
sun do the development / support of the logging and not reinventing he 
wheel.

&gt;&gt;<i> - Or to implentend and integrate a self-implemented and lightweight solution 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> maybe as derived a solution of the current Debug-Class.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First, I'd like to build a feature list. What are the requirements? What
</I>&gt;<i> do we want to log?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
I do agree that we need a list of requirements before we can make a 
choice. Personally I don't use logging, and I don't see myself using it 
any time soon, so I'm afraid I can't really help with that.
