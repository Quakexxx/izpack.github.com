<PRE>Hi all,

Since it was several wished, that IzPack *always* logs its steps and files 
that are written, substituted and executed to a _user-defined_ or 
timestamp-based logfile, I re-invoke this discussion.

- It is possible to integrate 3rdParty Loging Products such as log4j.
-to break a butterfly on a wheel ;-)

- Or to use the new Java.Logging classes functionality, which are to new in my 
opinion.

- Or to implentend and integrate a self-implemented and lightweight solution 
maybe as derived a solution of the current Debug-Class.

I would prefer a mixed solution: integrate borrowed / adapted code from Jog4J 
to meet what we need.- To hold this lightweight Installer as Lightweight 
Installer ;-)

But I also would vote for an own independed solution if easy adaptable / 
expandable in future.

Expecting Comments...

Cheers 
Marc
