<PRE>Hi there,

While this is useful from the validation point of view, I find it rather
cumbersome to have lots of XML files.

</I>
The contributed code simply checks whether there is an inline
definition. If there is none, the &quot;old&quot; way is used. Therefore, anybody
may choose to use inline or external XML.

&gt;<i> Uhm, i'm not sure if we need a vote here but i don't like this idea unless i
</I>&gt;<i> didn't get the real message behing this patch.
</I>
I just finished integrating this into the trunk and was about to commit
- good, that I checked back. Since it is 100% backwards compatible, I'd
say it enhances usability and doesn't hurt anybody who doesn't want to
use it.

Bye,

Tino.
