<PRE>Hello folks,

I've made a number of changes that I would like to contribute back to
IzPack.  I'm sending them to you to see if anybody has any objections to
them:
* I've changed the TableModel for the PacksPanel so that the
dependencies work both ways.  Assume that you have packs A and B, where
A depends on B.  Currently if you click on A it won't allow itself to be
checked until B is checked.  I've changed it so that if you click on A
then B will be checked automatically.  I would like to make this an
option whether you want this functionality or the original
functionality.  I'm proposing that this functionality be the default.
  * I've created a much, much more complex, but also nicer InstallPanel
that has pretty checkmarks and shows the status of the install on the
left while files are being copied and the ant tasks are running.  Our
install is really complicated - containing about 1.2 GB of software.
We've integrated a number of third party applications to our application
that need to be configured individually.  I'd like to offer an
&quot;AdvancedInstallPanel&quot; that handles some of these more complex
scenarios.
  * I'd like to fix a number of IzPack bugs related to installing more
than 2GB of software.  Currently IzPack uses integers to pass around the
size of modules/disk space where we need to use longs.  As I'm sure most
of you know, integerss can't be used to calculate spaces for more than
2GB.  Fixing this will also allow you to see the real size of the disk
space available.

Any comments?  Suggestions?  Opposition?

Ryan
