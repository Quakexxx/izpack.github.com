<PRE>Hi folks,

generally it is not a bad idea to use 3rd party libraries, particularly if
the issue to be solved would require a large amount of work. However, in my
experience one should exercises some caution and aim to strike a balance. If
there are too many dependencies on other libraries, that can become a
problem in itself.

I am not quite sure what we want to log, but I cannot imagine that a logging
facility is a big project. At least not if it doesn't have to be general
purpose. Not seeing the big gain, my vote goes toward implementing our own
solution.

Subject: [izpack-devel] Starting a discussion about logging


Hi all,

Since it was several wished, that IzPack *always* logs its steps and files
that are written, substituted and executed to a _user-defined_ or
timestamp-based logfile, I re-invoke this discussion.

- It is possible to integrate 3rdParty Loging Products such as log4j.
-to break a butterfly on a wheel ;-)

- Or to use the new Java.Logging classes functionality, which are to new in
my
opinion.

- Or to implentend and integrate a self-implemented and lightweight solution
maybe as derived a solution of the current Debug-Class.

I would prefer a mixed solution: integrate borrowed / adapted code from
Jog4J
to meet what we need.- To hold this lightweight Installer as Lightweight
Installer ;-)

But I also would vote for an own independed solution if easy adaptable /
expandable in future.

Expecting Comments...

Cheers
Marc
