<PRE>Hi Julien,

so far there was feedback on this proposal from you and Klaus. Both in favor
of the idea.

Klaus is right, off cause with the idea that we would be able to deal with
the permission issue on Windows with some native code. But as he also points
out, there are still other problems, such as sharing violations, that can't
be dealt with under any circumstance.

Branch: To be honest, I don't think this project is big enough for me to
install and deal with a new version control system. Therefore, if you agree,
I would like to do this work just with a local copy and insert the resulting
code into the repository with your support.

Design: I'll do some refinements then and send it out again, including a
specification for the localized strings to support the insertion of
variables.

About the decision to use a String[] to pass the variables: there is no
problem using a List for the purpose. On the other hand, in typical use
there will be either no variables or just one. In rare cases there might be
two or three. The variables will be inserted into the string based on their
position in the array and by definition we are always dealing with strings.
Under these circumstances I find it a bit out of proportion to press a List
into service. On the other hand, I don't feel exactly very strong about it,
so using a list is fine too.

Perhaps the ability to insert variables into localized text is of general
interest and should be packaged separately for use anywhere it is needed.
I'll include a separate class for this with my next message.

On some reflection I find that the package I placed the Messenger class in
is not optimal, because there are no UI components in the class itself
(naturally the information dialog will be a separate component). Therefore
I'll probably place it in the util package.

	Elmar

Hi Elmar,
&gt;<i> I am looking for feedback on the following proposal to deal with this
</I>issue
Just a quick feedback on the proposal: I think it does make sense to
collect messages to report issues this way. I went through the code and
I think I would use Lists rather than String[], but it is a very minor
issue :-)

Do you want to experiment this work in a branch?

Cheers
