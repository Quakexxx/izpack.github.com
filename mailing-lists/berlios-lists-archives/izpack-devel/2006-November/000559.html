<PRE>Hello Elmar,

IzPack won't overwrite a read-only file, but will overwrite it
otherwise.  I didn't put that feature in, but I do use it occasionally
if I change a file in my install that I want to test without rebuilding
the installer.  Then I can reinstall and my custom install tasks will
run with the new code instead.

Ryan

Hi Elmar,

I can't really answer you precisely because most of my install are from 
scratch. I will try to run some tests over the weekend.
I will try to put a cfg file just in case it could be related.
I think that the idea of a warning if something wasn't overiden. Better 
maybe would be to have the name of the file(s) which didn't.
Hace you have already made such test ?

Will get back to you if i find anything interesting.

Cheers,
Fabrice

Subject: [izpack-devel] overriding files


&gt;<i> Hi everyone,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am observing some installation problems and was wondering if anyone
</I>else
&gt;<i> has seen similar issues.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is, that sometimes the installer fails to override 
</I>&gt;<i> pre-existing
</I>&gt;<i> files even though it should. So far there seems to be no clear pattern
</I>as 
&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> when this happens or why. The only slight hint I have, has to do with
</I>the
&gt;<i> file name, but I am not sure about it, so don't let it mislead you. It
</I>
&gt;<i> seems
</I>&gt;<i> to happen with a file that has the extension .cfg, which is also used
</I>by 
&gt;<i> MS
</I>&gt;<i> Outlook.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Apart from the problem I am observing right now, I think there is
</I>always a
&gt;<i> possibility that a file cannot be overridden. Therefore it might be a
</I>good
&gt;<i> idea to test this during installation have some warning to the
</I>operator 
&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> the installation might not have completely succeeded. Any comments?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       Elmar
