<PRE>Hi everyone,

I am observing some installation problems and was wondering if anyone else
has seen similar issues.

The problem is, that sometimes the installer fails to override pre-existing
files even though it should. So far there seems to be no clear pattern as to
when this happens or why. The only slight hint I have, has to do with the
file name, but I am not sure about it, so don't let it mislead you. It seems
to happen with a file that has the extension .cfg, which is also used by MS
Outlook.

Apart from the problem I am observing right now, I think there is always a
possibility that a file cannot be overridden. Therefore it might be a good
idea to test this during installation have some warning to the operator that
the installation might not have completely succeeded. Any comments?

       Elmar
