<PRE>Hi Tino,

ok, I understand now that you are deploying a set of Java Server Pages.
However, since these and all classes in use will be compiled automatically
by the server, I understand the need for a compile step during installation
even less.

I don't want to talk you out of what you are doing, but I think it is an
extremely unusual use of the installer. Therefore the routine inclusion of
another 4 MB for the Eclipse JDT Compiler seems out of proportion. As an
example, the full deployment of my rather extensive GUI Application is
around 5MB. Including the 4MB for the compiler for no reason at all, would
practically double that! Since distribution is mostly by download, this
would put a BIG burden on my customers (dial up is still widely used).

If this feature is really necessary at all I would go along with Klaus'
recommendation to include the compiler only if necessary.

	Elmar

The original motivation was as follows: We build an installer from
several CVS modules. They have a directory structure like this:

module1/sources/java/com/...
module1/sources/jsp/...
module2/sources/java/com/...
module2/sources/jsp/...

and so on. The final installation has a totally different layout.
The contents of the modules are copied to several locations, e.g.

webroot/WEB-INF/classes/java/com/module1
webroot/jsp/module1
webroot/WEB-INF/classes/java/com/module2
webroot/jsp/module2

It is even more complicated than that.

Initially there was no way to compile the sources before they were
installed by the installer. Therefore I developed the CompilePanel which
also allows the user to use a custom Java compiler. It also ensures that
all external depencies of the application are met (like a J2EE
application server and JAI). If it compiles upon installation, the
application will most probably work.

Bye,

Tino.
