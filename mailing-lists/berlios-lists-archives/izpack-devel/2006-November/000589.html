<PRE>I think it's done. The patch should be applied against the current 
trunk, not over the previous patch. The only deviation from the plan was 
that I made the packs with a specified excludeGroup to be 
preselected=&quot;no&quot; by default (it's annoying to write it manually for each 
of the member packs, because most of them need to be preselected=&quot;no&quot; 
anyway). So the feature description becomes:

1. &quot;excludeGroup&quot; is an attribute (ATTLIST) of element &quot;pack&quot;

2. &quot;excludeGroup&quot; can only contain one group.

3. This group is a String which is unique for one group of all
&quot;excludeGroup&quot;s, but has no relation to other groups like the
&quot;installGroups&quot; or the pack name or id.

4. A functional  &quot;excludeGroup&quot; can contain at least two members. A 
member is
a pack which has the attribute &quot;excludeGroup&quot; with the given name.
If only one member is declared, nothing will be done.

5. A member in the &quot;excludeGroup&quot; cannot have the attribute 
&quot;required=&quot;yes&quot;&quot;.

6. Only one member in the &quot;excludeGroup&quot; can have the attribute 
&quot;preselected=&quot;yes&quot;&quot;.
Packs, which have an excludeGroup attribute are not preselected by 
default (Unlike
the packs with no specified excludeGroup).

7. From all members of an &quot;excludeGroup&quot; only one member can be
selected. One member of the group is mutually exclusive to each other 
member.
If a second pack is selected, the previous will be deselected. If no 
previous pack
from the same excludeGroup is selected, the pack will be selected without
excluding any other packs.

Let me know.
