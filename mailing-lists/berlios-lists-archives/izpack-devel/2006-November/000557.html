<PRE>Hi Fabrice,

yes I agree. If one or more files were not written successfully there should
be more than just a general warning. A list of the offending files might be
helpful.

I think I remember a discussion thread some time ago about a logging
facility. Do you know if that project ever got of the ground? If so we might
be able to tap into that, if not, maybe it's time to get started on
something like that. The warning message could then include the name and
location of the log file, which would contain the details.

Hi Elmar,

I can't really answer you precisely because most of my install are from
scratch. I will try to run some tests over the weekend.
I will try to put a cfg file just in case it could be related.
I think that the idea of a warning if something wasn't overiden. Better
maybe would be to have the name of the file(s) which didn't.
Hace you have already made such test ?

Will get back to you if i find anything interesting.

Cheers,
Fabrice

&gt;<i> Hi everyone,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am observing some installation problems and was wondering if anyone else
</I>&gt;<i> has seen similar issues.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is, that sometimes the installer fails to override
</I>&gt;<i> pre-existing
</I>&gt;<i> files even though it should. So far there seems to be no clear pattern as
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> when this happens or why. The only slight hint I have, has to do with the
</I>&gt;<i> file name, but I am not sure about it, so don't let it mislead you. It
</I>&gt;<i> seems
</I>&gt;<i> to happen with a file that has the extension .cfg, which is also used by
</I>&gt;<i> MS
</I>&gt;<i> Outlook.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Apart from the problem I am observing right now, I think there is always a
</I>&gt;<i> possibility that a file cannot be overridden. Therefore it might be a good
</I>&gt;<i> idea to test this during installation have some warning to the operator
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> the installation might not have completely succeeded. Any comments?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       Elmar
