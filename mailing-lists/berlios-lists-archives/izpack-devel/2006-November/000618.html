<PRE>Hi Stefan,

one comment I would like to add:

&gt;<i> 3. Pack selection: For me, automatically selecting all packs in the
</I>choosen installation group was
&gt;<i> not suitable. Therefore I added the variable
</I>&quot;InstallationGroupPanel.doNotSelectPacks&quot;. If this
&gt;<i> variable has the value &quot;yes&quot; then the available packs are not
</I>automatically selected when leaving
&gt;<i> the panel.
</I>
I feel it would be a little more logical to reverse the logic by renaming
the variable to

&quot;InstallationGroupPanel.selectPacks&quot;

The default may still be 'yes'

Subject: [izpack-devel] remarks and patch for InstallationGroupPanel


Hi all,

I added the great InstallationGroupPanel to my setup and had to do some
adjustments that might be of
general interest:

1. Missing resource: My installer has useHeadingPanel=&quot;yes&quot;. In order to use
the heading layout a
resource named &quot;InstallationGroupPanel.headline&quot; is required. This resource
should be defined in the
distribution. I propose &quot;installation type&quot; for its value.

2. Minor bug: Calculating the available packs the InstallationGroupPanel
does not consider the OS
constraints of the packs.

3. Pack selection: For me, automatically selecting all packs in the choosen
installation group was
not suitable. Therefore I added the variable
&quot;InstallationGroupPanel.doNotSelectPacks&quot;. If this
variable has the value &quot;yes&quot; then the available packs are not automatically
selected when leaving
the panel.

4. I18N: I had to I18N the panel. I know that currently there is some
general work on this issue in
progress. Yet, I needed it now, and did some improvements based on the
suggestions posted at

Cheers,
--Stefan
