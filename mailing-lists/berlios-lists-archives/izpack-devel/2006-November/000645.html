<PRE>Hi Tino,

I think (2) is quite ok.

BTW, the server will also automatically compile the classes that provide the
supporting infrastructure, not the just the jsp stuff.

I'm not talking about the JSPs, I'm talking about lots and lots of
classes which provide the infrastructure (plus more) for the JSPs.

I would not make this mandatory.

I'm seeing three possible ways:
1) don't include the JDT compiler at all, just provide instructions on
how to obtain it and how to include it
2) include the JDT compiler in the IzPack distribution, only add it to
the installer if the CompilePanel is used
3) include the JDT compiler in the IzPack distribution, only add it to
the installer if the CompilePanel is used and it is especially requested

I'm in favor of way 2, but the first one is also okay for me.

Bye,

Tino.
