<PRE>Hi Elmar,
I think all developer of IzPack knows that there are some 
points in the product which are not optimal solved. Of course,
we should solve it if possible and time is right on work-time-device.

Some weeks ago I have had a little problem with logging; I log
some things which are interested especially for me, but it will be
logged if logging is activated. One user persisted on the 
meaning that the logged information was fatal for IzPack.

Therefore it will be nice if the new logging stuff will be support
different topics (as you have decribed) and logs a prefix. May be
configurable what topic should be logged.

Cheers

Klaus

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Just a quick answer on the remarks by Markus Schlegel, 
</I>&gt;<i>specifically this
</I>&gt;<i>one:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;After working for some days with izpack, I have to mention, 
</I>&gt;<i>that silently
</I>&gt;<i>gulping a general Exception is not a good practice. You should 
</I>&gt;<i>maybe use
</I>&gt;<i>some logging api to log such exceptions - just for 
</I>&gt;<i>troubleshooting. It's ok
</I>&gt;<i>for specific exceptions that are expected to be thrown. So if 
</I>&gt;<i>you plan to
</I>&gt;<i>make some refactoring in the future, this may be a point to look at.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Markus is absolutely right. I think there is some work left in 
</I>&gt;<i>IzPack to
</I>&gt;<i>ensure it really is as stable as we all would like and that 
</I>&gt;<i>any problems
</I>&gt;<i>encountered during installation are reported to the operator.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>A couple of days ago I sent out a message with the following 
</I>&gt;<i>subject line:
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;Proposal for Messenger class&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>This is a proposal about a logging infrastructure to deal with 
</I>&gt;<i>exactly this
</I>&gt;<i>issue. In the meanwhile it is mostly implemented and ready to 
</I>&gt;<i>be integrated
</I>&gt;<i>with IzPack. In the near future there will be some messages to 
</I>&gt;<i>request your
</I>&gt;<i>input and support on a number of related topics. Logging calls 
</I>&gt;<i>will be very
</I>&gt;<i>simple to implement, so I hope there will be heavy use of this 
</I>&gt;<i>feature by
</I>&gt;<i>everyone. 
</I>&gt;<i>
