<PRE>This is indeed an ugly thing.

You mention specifically the shortcut as a problem. Is this only an example
or is it the only place where this behavior actually leads to a problem? If
it is the only place, then we might be able to come up with a local
solution. If it is not, then I suspect a modification of File itself might
not be sufficient, because this problem could also happen with the content
of the shortcut, not just with the shortcut file...

Perhaps some more analysis is required to find all possible ways in which
this problem could affect the performance of IzPack.

Subject: [izpack-devel] bad file names


Dear colleagues,
on the user list there was someone which
uses a name of a shortcut which contained a colon.
We all know, that this is not allowed on Windows.
But the API of Windows accept such nonsens
without any warning or error. I have tested it for
installed files via &lt;singelfile&gt;. Also no warning
or error. The result is a file with a name upto the
colon. The file cannot be opened and not removed.
Uninstall fails at this point. In the moment I do not
know how cleanup.
May be this can cast a damning light on IzPack.

Therefore I am thinking about how we can avoid
such ugly usage of our product. One way can be to
inherit File to a class which verifies a valid filename
OS dependant (it seems so that on Linux such nonsens
is allowed). There are many constructor calls of
File, therefore a little bit more work.
Additional there is the problem if this is not
used in custom code.
Any comment?
Any better solution?

Cheers

Klaus
