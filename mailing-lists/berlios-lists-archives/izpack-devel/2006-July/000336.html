</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks for your work - could you please submit your patch again in

</I>&gt;<i>Sorry for my knowing-nothing-about-diff. I was relying on some visual

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I hope you can use one of these.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I also cleaned up two compiler warnings happening with jdk

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> this will probably stop compilation with jdk 1.4 if that

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not sure about our policy regarding the compiler. At least, the

</I>&gt;<i>I haven't tested it with older Java versions. No problem with leaving

</I>&gt;<i>that they don't compile in your standard build. :-( So I changed them
</I>&gt;<i>again for the 1492 diff.
</I>
I think we should not use the Java language extensions of version 5.0
in the moment. It is possible to do some things dependent on the
VM version but things like parameterized types cannot be used because
it is not possibel (I think) to compile with compiler compliance 1.4.
Since IzPack 3.8 the &quot;lowest&quot; VM version is 1.4.
If your develop tool creates warnings with 5.0, use VM 1.4 or
compliance to 1.4.
I am just going to 5.0, but there are more than one people which do
not go to 5.0 until the crashes at end of installation are foretime.
