</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Klaus,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>a couple of things.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>1) Layout Manager
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Since you mention the use of GridBagLayout, I might be able to 
</I>&gt;<i>support you
</I>&gt;<i>in this quest. If you managed to ever make GridBagLayout work 
</I>&gt;<i>for a layout,
</I>&gt;<i>more power to you. I don't consider myself a dimwit but I 
</I>&gt;<i>never managed to
</I>&gt;<i>make use of it in any productive way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Anyway, I found that a layout manager of the type grid layout 
</I>&gt;<i>if quite often
</I>&gt;<i>what is called for. Unfortunately neither GridLayout nor GridBagLayout
</I>&gt;<i>really work for most real world cases. Well GridBagLayout 
</I>&gt;<i>might, but setting
</I>&gt;<i>up all the constraints is so complicated and takes so much 
</I>&gt;<i>code that one
</I>&gt;<i>might just as well go ahead and write an entire layout manger. 
</I>
I have used the GridBagLayout for most of my IzPanels in the past.
But - what you adumbrate - the result is a little bit beside what
I would have. Major problem is the MultiLineLabel because its width
depence on the hight and vice versa. In my prototype of a 
layout manager I compute the layout two times if there are hints
that a Component will change hight if width should change.

&gt;<i>One day I got
</I>&gt;<i>so fed up by this problem that I wrote a layout manager that 
</I>&gt;<i>did exactly
</I>&gt;<i>what I thought GridLayout should do in the first place to be 
</I>&gt;<i>really useful.
</I>&gt;<i>I call it TableLayout, because it produces a layout just like 
</I>&gt;<i>an HTML table.
</I>&gt;<i>This means that components are laid out in rows and columns, just as in
</I>&gt;<i>GridLayout but each row is just as tall as it needs to be and 
</I>&gt;<i>all columns
</I>&gt;<i>are just as wide as they need to be. This means it can also be 
</I>&gt;<i>used as a
</I>&gt;<i>FlowLayout and as a *vertical* form of FlowLayout. It would 
</I>&gt;<i>also be able to
</I>&gt;<i>replace the ColumnLayout that I had written for the UnserInputPanel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If you think this layout could help solving your issue, or 
</I>&gt;<i>might be useful
</I>&gt;<i>as a starting point, I would be willing to contribute it to 
</I>&gt;<i>the project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It sounds like that it do just the things I need.
It will be nice if you can send it. May be to my berlios account.
Perhaps it is better as my proto type or there are good things in it
I self never can thought about.
&gt;<i>2) Docu
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>No problem with that. Again, I know that a lot of folks have a 
</I>&gt;<i>real hurdle
</I>&gt;<i>to overcome on this point. Just please care enough to send 
</I>&gt;<i>Fabrice the info,
</I>&gt;<i>so that he can take care of it. And as I mentioned in me mail, 
</I>&gt;<i>I am willing
</I>&gt;<i>to help with writing text as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>	Elmar
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Most I trial to synchronise the XHTML docu with my changes.
If needed, I can send Fabrice a &quot;ping&quot;, but I think normaly he
see my changes.
Only things which are related with implementing something in
IzPack ( like a layout manager) are not documented in the XHTML 
docu else in the code self. This can be written in a
system manual, but the IzPack docu is a user manual, I think.
