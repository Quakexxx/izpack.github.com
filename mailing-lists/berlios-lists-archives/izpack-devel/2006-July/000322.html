<PRE>Hi Guys,

First of all, i want to sat sorry if i missed fixes or new features in the
docu.
I have been very busy for the past few months(got married, planning to move
to toronto, transfer from my company and all bunch of administration stuffs)
I do agree that i took the responsability to take care and maintain a full
documentation as friendly as possible.

I don't think i made any changes to your stuffs but probalby people did. I
can understand how frustation it is to upgrade to a new version and not
being able to understand what's going on with the things you developped
yourself !
I want to say that we all know how great and useful the job you've done is !
No doubt about that ! The shorcuts stuffs is simply great !

The current situation with the docu is not too bad. To make it clearer, i
have the intention to put everything in DocBook as it's the best format for
further conversion (DocBook to HTML, PDF or any other kind basically).
Only problem is that i'm struggling to find a real good way to implement it
into the ant tasks.
I have a bunch of issues with the generated code.
I worked for W3C and that's why i'm a fan of Strict Versions. The XHTML
Version of the docu is fully validated.
Once i generate it from docbook it's not anymore. I have to work on this and
it's taking me quite a lot of time.

Right now, all changes to docu are made first into XHTML and then i upgrade
the DocBook accordingly. This will be the case until i manage to have the
parser working fine.
Once done, we could also generate a pdf out of it.

All i ask from developpers is not much, once a code is changed or a new
feature created, send me or to the list a brief descrition of wha'ts it's
used for and how to to use it.

Latex file can be removed, however i suggest to leave XHTML and DocBook
until i finalize the parser or find a good one already made ;-)

As an example, Klaus latest changes came with XHTML docu updates + new
langpack strings.
This is great, thanks for that ! I'll make sure to update the corresponding
DocBook as well as other launguage (the one i can of course: italien french
and i can ask for russian...)

As you mentioned Julien, SVN and previously CVS gives us the changes made so
we can all go through what's have been done or added or changed... and make
a list of changes/features.

Could we work on that together ? we can decide of a starting date. I think
from the versions.txt we can easely from where to start until now.

Once again, my apologies for those who the missing docu have caused
problems!
I'll try to fix that asap.

Cheers,
Fabrice

&gt;<i> Hi Elmar,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I understand your frustration, especially when you have rigorous quality
</I>&gt;<i> standards (which is a very good thing anyway, and I am the first one to
</I>&gt;<i> enjoy that). The decision to switch the documentation from LaTeX to XHTML
</I>&gt;<i> (then soon DocBook) had been made on common consensus. Fabrice is devoting
</I>&gt;<i> a lot of his precious time on this task, and should be thanked for that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yet, we have this problem of documentation, which is probably larger than
</I>&gt;<i> the IzPack project. Generally speaking, developers don't like writing
</I>&gt;<i> documentation. That's the sad yet true truth. The fact that we are in a
</I>&gt;<i> transition period over the documentation format is probably another factor
</I>&gt;<i> that discourages people of ensuring that new features are documented.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suggest the following:
</I>&gt;<i> - current developers *must* make sure that they include documentation with
</I>&gt;<i> new features they add
</I>&gt;<i> - current developers *must* check that code from external contributors
</I>&gt;<i> comes along with documentation before they perform the commit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The good thing is that we can check the commits on izpack-changes. Since
</I>&gt;<i> SVN makes atomic commits, we can see when a changeset is missing docs ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, it would be good that Fabrice tells us which format (XHTML or
</I>&gt;<i> DocBook) should be used right now for the documentation. We should also
</I>&gt;<i> think about cleaning the folders in src/, since there are still the LaTeX,
</I>&gt;<i> XHTML and DocBook files.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers
</I>&gt;<i>
