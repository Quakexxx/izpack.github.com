<PRE>Hi Elmar,

I understand your frustration, especially when you have rigorous quality
standards (which is a very good thing anyway, and I am the first one to
enjoy that). The decision to switch the documentation from LaTeX to XHTML
(then soon DocBook) had been made on common consensus. Fabrice is devoting
a lot of his precious time on this task, and should be thanked for that.

Yet, we have this problem of documentation, which is probably larger than
the IzPack project. Generally speaking, developers don't like writing
documentation. That's the sad yet true truth. The fact that we are in a
transition period over the documentation format is probably another factor
that discourages people of ensuring that new features are documented.

I suggest the following:
- current developers *must* make sure that they include documentation with
new features they add
- current developers *must* check that code from external contributors
comes along with documentation before they perform the commit.

The good thing is that we can check the commits on izpack-changes. Since
SVN makes atomic commits, we can see when a changeset is missing docs ;-)

Also, it would be good that Fabrice tells us which format (XHTML or
DocBook) should be used right now for the documentation. We should also
think about cleaning the folders in src/, since there are still the LaTeX,
XHTML and DocBook files.

Cheers


</PRE>
