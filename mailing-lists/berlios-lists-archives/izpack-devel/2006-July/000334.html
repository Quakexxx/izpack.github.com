Well, the ultimate solution would be conditional inputs (like choosing
type of database first, then displaying only settings applicable for the
selected type). But this is already helpful. :-)

Thanks for your work - could you please submit your patch again in
unified diff format (pass -u to diff).

&gt;<i> I also cleaned up two compiler warnings happening with jdk 1.5 (though

I'm not sure about our policy regarding the compiler. At least, the
installer should run on Java 1.3 IIRC.

Bye,

Tino.
