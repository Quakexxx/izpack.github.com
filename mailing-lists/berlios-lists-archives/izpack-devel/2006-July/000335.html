Sure... - but I don't want to torment the setup user with technical JDBC
details too much, and therefore I want to silently set those variables.

However, conditional inputs combined with &quot;hidden&quot; fields would probably
do the trick quite nicely (adding another feature to the ultimate
solution). :-)

Sorry for my knowing-nothing-about-diff. I was relying on some visual
diff tool. Oh, I just realize that it was based on the latest release
version of the file, not on the one from the svn trunk...

Now, I have included a unified diff to the release version (3.8.1) -
which I have tested and am working with - as well as the diff Subversion
generates for the latest trunk revision (1492) when I apply my changes
to it - which compiles, but is yet untested.

I hope you can use one of these.

</I>
I haven't tested it with older Java versions. No problem with leaving
those two cleanups out of the patch if you want. In fact, I just noticed
that they don't compile in your standard build. :-( So I changed them
again for the 1492 diff.
