<PRE>Hi all,
such often I have this time already problems with the
layout in my IzPanels. Normally I use a GridBagLayout,
but it does not really what I need. Also other 
layouts do not fully what I need. 
If I look into existent panels some of them are a little
bit other layout as others. This is a little bit ugly
because our usability freak is fussy...
Additional I need NORTHWEST as anchor.

Therefore I play with the idea to create a layout manager for IzPanels
which allows to use the same insets, gaps, anchors etc. in all
panels which uses this layout manager. Last time I have checked in
some things (gaps, anchor) to make layout configurable. This will
be supported by the layout manager, of course.
My prototyp can manage the MultiLineLabel (that's from Elmar) also
at resizing. Other layout manager are confusing with that label.

The problem will be that changes at existent common classes are
needed.
I will do it for the common classes ownded by me and I would do it
with the common classes I use (from Elmar I use ShortcutPanel).
Some classes cannot use such a layout manager (e.g. PacksPanel).
I have written little bit docu for &quot;Modifying the GUI&quot;. May be some
more will be needed. 
But I am one of the people which hate writing docu...

The viewable layout will be change only a little bit, I hope.

Any comment?

Cheers

Klaus
