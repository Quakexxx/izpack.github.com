<PRE>In the next few days, I'll be finishing setting up the web part of the 
installer for my program.  Since I want my clients to be able to 
download the software and not others, I'm encrypting the packs (which 
is something I'll be including later, after Fabrice gets back and we 
post the SimpleConfig classes we've been working on).  I also don't 
want anyone to be able to easily link to the packs the installer needs.

Has anyone else ever included a Perl program and parameters in the 
&lt;webdir&gt; element?  I was going to add the client's name and password to 
the URL and have it connect with HTTPS so the password is not revealed.  
Basically, the webdir URL would look like this:

<A HREF="https://mysite.com/perl/install.pl?user=username&amp;password=passwd&amp;pack=">https://mysite.com/perl/install.pl?user=username&amp;password=passwd&amp;pack=</A>

The idea is that when IzPack asks for a pack, the file name will end up 
being placed at the end of the parameters and look like a parameter 
itself, so the Perl CGI script can verify the username and password 
before sending the pack back to the user for install.

Since this is a bit unusual, from what I've seen, I wanted to ask if 
anyone had done this with IzPack and if there were hidden traps they 
might have found.  I figure by using this, I ask my user for the 
username and password only once, they download the initial jar file to 
run, and the jar file itself will have the url, with the username and 
password included within.

Thanks for any information or experiences if anyone has done anything 
like this.

Hal
