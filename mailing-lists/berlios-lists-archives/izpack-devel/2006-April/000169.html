I'm not a developer, but I know you (as in Julien) know some of the work 
I've been doing that I'll be contributing.  Does that count?

Anyways, I vote &quot;yes&quot;.

How is Fabrice is going to be able to vote?  Now that he's a newlywed 
and in Punta Cana, do you really think there's even the slightest 
chance he's going to take time out of his honeymoon in a Carribean 
resort to pay attention to anything having to do with computers?  (If 
he is thinking about computers, I'm going to really start wondering 
about him....)
