I looked at that.  I need something slightly different.  For installing my 
app, I was writing a panel that would see if the user was root on Linux or 
Administrator on Windows.  The the user was one of these, the panel would 
never show.  Otherwise it would show up with a message like, &quot;This program 
must be installed as root.  Please exit and run again as root.&quot;  (or 
s/root/Administrator/g if you're on Windows)

As long as I needed it, I thought I'd see if it would be easy to make it work 
on a Mac as well and make it for everyone.
