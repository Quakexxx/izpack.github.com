I figure if it's done by adding an extra method that panels can use, in most 
cases, the behavior won't change.  For example, ProcessPanel would still work 
as is.  It would allow a panel, though, to find out when someone is leaving 
the panel by pressing &quot;Prev.&quot;  Here's an example: I am writing a panel that 
searches the hard drive for specified versions of programs that my program 
needs.  That takes a while, and the only way I can do it without a sloppy 
look is to make it a separate thread (once the &quot;search&quot; button is pressed, it 
keeps that pressed look and the GUI is not updated until the search is done).

If &quot;Next&quot; is pressed, I can kill the search thread from isValidated().  
(Actually, I lock &quot;Next&quot; while the search is being performed.)  I'd like to 
know when/if &quot;Prev&quot; is pressed so I can kill the thread, instead of leaving 
it running while other panels are being used.

Hal
