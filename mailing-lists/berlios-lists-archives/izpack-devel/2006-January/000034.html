On Linux, there's basically no standard way. You usually install
software as root. It's distro dependent how you can get root via a
graphical interface. Usually there are su-wrappers or you end up with a
root shell.

Actually, because of package management (RPM, DPKG etc.) there's usually
no need to &quot;become root&quot; for software installation since installation is
done non-interactively. AFAIK graphical package management usually has it's
own method to request root privileges (e.g. asking for password, then
using su).

Bye, Tino.
