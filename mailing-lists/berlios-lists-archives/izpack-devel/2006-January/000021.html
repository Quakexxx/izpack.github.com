</I>
I'm also using RealVNC, and haven't checked yet.  It's one of those things 
Windows developers would be much more aware of than others.  I may write the 
code for the directory search (I think there's one in UserInput that I can 
copy) and let a Windows person write the registry code, if someone would 
like.  That's a ways off.  The first step is to get it working!  ;-)  Then 
it's time to figure out things like that.

...
&gt;<i> &gt; I was thinking of something close to that, but I've seen programs change
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; version messages from one version to another (other than just updating
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; version number).  It'd be more work, but more accurate, to specify a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; command
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (and parameters) and a list of acceptable or unacceptable strings to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; search
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for in the output.  For example:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; $ bigapp --version
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; BigApp, (C) 2005 by Megalithic Corporation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Version 2.1.9
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; $bigapp --version
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Monolithic Corporation, a Megalithic subsidary
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; BigApp 1.9.2
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (C) 2005
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Since we're dealing with all programs out there, this would allow the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; developer to specify strings to match all acceptable (and some non
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; acceptable) verisons.  A little more work, but it provides much more in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; terms
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of ability and accuracy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree. Because this behavior of real programms I have implemented a
</I>&gt;<i> version
</I>&gt;<i> scanner in JDKPathPanel (line 167ff).
</I>
I'll have to look at that.  I think I remember having that problem at one 
point a few years back when I had to figure out what version of Java a system 
was using.

...
&gt;<i> &gt; I prefer the simpler panels.  I experimentend, though, and found just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for multiple panels was not hard.  There are some custom panels I'm using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that I need several times, and I found it easy to set that up.  But
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; UserInput
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is definitely a complex panel.  I have no desire to write anything that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; complex -- which is why I was thinking of doing this as a series of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; panels.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have accepted this rule of IzPack (a panel is like a singelton) long
</I>&gt;<i> time ago.
</I>&gt;<i> What I do is to write a base or intermediaer class which is configurable
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> the derived classes are most only configure the base class. That was the
</I>&gt;<i> primary idea of splitting TargetPanel into a base class (PathInputPanel)
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> a really short derived TargetPanel. I think, I have ~ 6 panels derived
</I>&gt;<i>  from it.
</I>&gt;<i> OK, JDKPathPanel is not so short...
</I>
I've looked at those panels in passing.  I am not sure yet, but I think I can 
use PathInputPanel as part of what I'm doing.  It's easier to figure out what 
3 panels of 200-400 lines are doing, if each handles separate tasks, then 
trying to read 600-1200 lines of code.  (And, the part I like is that it's 
easier to debug!)

&gt;<i> We have in our server installation a customized JBoss installation. In my
</I>&gt;<i> JBossPathPanel I ask with a Dialog triggert in the
</I>&gt;<i> JBossPathPanel.panelActivate()
</I>&gt;<i> the user whether he/she would install the customized JBoss or use an
</I>&gt;<i> allready
</I>&gt;<i> installed JBoss. Dependant on the return value of the Dialog I configure
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> JBossPathPanel whether it should handle a path for the new customized
</I>&gt;<i> installation
</I>&gt;<i> or a allready existent product. Late configure of PathInputPanel is
</I>&gt;<i> possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK, I tend to resolve problems via inheritance. You can do it in your way,
</I>&gt;<i> that's
</I>&gt;<i> one of the big benefit of IzPack I think.
</I>
I think I'd use inheritance more if I understood it or was more used to it.  
I'm self taught, especially in Java, and I learned what I have needed to 
write the programs I needed.  I'm learning more about using inheritance in 
IzPack than I've learned before (and some of that is through the path panels 
you wrote and mentioned here -- so thanks!)
