<PRE>Sorry, intended to send this to Fabrice for comments before I put it on the 
list.  Senility strikes again!

Oh, well.  As long as it's posted, I'd be interested in comments on this 
suggestion.  I know Klaus is not able to type, so he's not online at the 
moment, but I'd like to know if there are reasons to add or not to add this 
one piece of functionality.

(I hate it when I do that!)

</I>&gt;<i> How's the weekend going?  I hope you're having fun and doing lots of the
</I>&gt;<i> things I'm dreaming of doing once I get all this stuff done!  (What's the
</I>&gt;<i> weather like there now?  We're having almost a heat wave and temperatures
</I>&gt;<i> are more like we expect in April than January, but a weather front moved
</I>&gt;<i> through last night, bringing thunder storms and it's suddenly getting
</I>&gt;<i> cold!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm working on a Path panel.  I wanted to use Klaus' PathInputPanel, but
</I>&gt;<i> there are enough parts of it custom tailored to TargetPanel that it won't
</I>&gt;<i> work, at least not easily.  I tried using Klaus' other panel,
</I>&gt;<i> PathSelectionPanel, but I find one small problem, here it is:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are two components in PathSelectionPanel, a JTextField and a JButton.
</I>&gt;<i> You can access the JTextField, which lets you get or set the text and add a
</I>&gt;<i> listener, but there is no way to access the JButton, which brings up a
</I>&gt;<i> JFileChooser.  I'm suggesting making a small modification to this class so
</I>&gt;<i> the button can be accessed.  In my case, I'd like to add an ActionListener
</I>&gt;<i> that is slightly different than the one Klaus uses.  Here's an example of
</I>&gt;<i> what I *think* is a problem with the current ActionListener: If you the
</I>&gt;<i> current path in the JTextField is /usr/lib/openoffice, which is the
</I>&gt;<i> directory you plan on installing to, and the JFileChooser realizes the
</I>&gt;<i> entire path does not exist, it defaults to /home/username.  Without going
</I>&gt;<i> into details, I want a different behavior.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am suggestion to add one method at the end of PathSelectionPanel:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> public JButton getBrowseButton()
</I>&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;<i> 	return browseButton;
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's it!  Just allow another class using PathSelectionPanel to access the
</I>&gt;<i> browseButton to change the text or change the ActionListener.  The only
</I>&gt;<i> downside I can see is that this allows people to change the behavior of the
</I>&gt;<i> browseButton so it won't always be the same.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At this point, I'm creating a class, AlteredPathSelectionPanel, so I can
</I>&gt;<i> use it with this change.  If it's acceptable to add this one method to
</I>&gt;<i> PathSelectionPanel, I can change my code to use the regular class.  As I've
</I>&gt;<i> said, I am trying to make sure that I do not change existing code or add
</I>&gt;<i> things like this to existing classes, but this seems to make sense, so I
</I>&gt;<i> thought I'd bring it up and see what you thought.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Keep well,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hal
