You can't really do that because the order and number of panels that are
displayed is static. You could write a single custom panel that acts
like multiple panels but the common next/previous buttons wouldn't work.

Are you actually managing to install multiple instances of the software
from a single installer. I didn't think that was possible. In any case,
if you want multiple running instances of the software, it is better to
install one copy of the software and keep any data and configuration for
each running instance separate.
