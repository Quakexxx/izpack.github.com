<PRE>Hi Loic,

&gt;<i> I noted that the &quot;shortcut localization&quot; patch we had set up with Klaus at
</I>&gt;<i> the end of april (see messages below) doesn't seem to have been included in
</I>&gt;<i> the release (though Klaus had checked it into the trunk two weeks before the
</I>&gt;<i> release, and that it stills appear correctly in the SVN version - and works
</I>&gt;<i> as expected if I compile my own standalone-comipler.jar).
</I>
What you have in a release is just an export from SVN, so if Klaus had
commited it, it must be in the code.

&gt;<i> I also noted that the documentation in the release hasn't been updated
</I>&gt;<i> either (which is coherent with the patch not being included), but the svn
</I>&gt;<i> documentation has not been updated either. Maybe you'll want to commit the
</I>&gt;<i> patch I sent you so that the feature is properly documented.
</I>
I am in the (lengthy) process of converting the documentation to a
nicer format. As soon as it is finished, I will call for reviews to
rework and fix the documentation which is clearly outdated on many
points.

&gt;<i> Is 3.10.3 planned already ?
</I>
I'm not feeling like releasing such a maintainance release because of
time (I have started writing my phd thesis). The next one will rather
be a 3.11.0. October may be a good time for the release.

For the patch that was not added, you should see with Fabrice, but I
guess he is very busy as well ;-)

Cheers

</PRE>
