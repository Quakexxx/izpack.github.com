<PRE>Hi Vladimir,

Just a quick note for everyone: I am very busy at work these days, but
I will quickly continue the work on the documentation, don't worry :-)

&gt;<i> I am also rewriting the download dialog, because the old one is just
</I>&gt;<i> spinning and seems to hang sometimes. This new dialog will track the
</I>&gt;<i> bytes from the stream and display basic stats, when content length is
</I>&gt;<i> not available from the HTTP headers it will go in indeterminate mode but
</I>&gt;<i> still show the speed. Of course, when the connection fails it still asks
</I>&gt;<i> for proxy and everything that was implemented in the previous version.
</I>&gt;<i> Let me know you have some other ideas.
</I>
That sounds very good to me. I actually think that you are going to
rewrite it exactly as it should have been in the first place :-)

&gt;<i> One bigger change is that the pack stream is not accessed with a jar:
</I>&gt;<i> protocol URL, because it wants to download the whole containing jar
</I>&gt;<i> before giving the stream to the inner jar and thus it's not possible to
</I>&gt;<i> track the stream status. Now, it will download the containing jar to a
</I>&gt;<i> local temp file and proceeds from there. This reminds me that probably
</I>&gt;<i> we need to require twice the really required space in the packs panel
</I>&gt;<i> (because it first downloads the containing pack jar and then installs).
</I>&gt;<i> I know that the packs show the uncompressed size and the jars can be
</I>&gt;<i> significantly smaller , but have in mind that these files take more
</I>&gt;<i> space on the file system than their actual size, so it's good to have
</I>&gt;<i> some reserve. What do you think?
</I>
The thing is that as you said accessing through the jar:protocol is blocking.

Yes, twice the space makes sense.

An idea just came to my mind: are you planning to add integrity and
authenticity checkings? People will probably want to check what they
get from the remote servers.

&gt;<i> BTW, here is my snadbox repository
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://repository.jboss.com/jems-installer-web-repository/test-7-6-2007/">http://repository.jboss.com/jems-installer-web-repository/test-7-6-2007/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and this is the latest web installer
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://repository.jboss.com/jems-installer-web-repository/test-7-6-2007/jems-web-installer-1.2.1.RC2.jar">http://repository.jboss.com/jems-installer-web-repository/test-7-6-2007/jems-web-installer-1.2.1.RC2.jar</A>
</I>
Thanks!
