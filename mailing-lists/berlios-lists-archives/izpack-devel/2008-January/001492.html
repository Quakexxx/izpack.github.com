<PRE>Hi Tino;

&gt;<i> I'm against moving by principle. For me, the BerliOS infrastructure
</I>&gt;<i> works very well, I've never had problems (but I'm no active developer at
</I>&gt;<i> the moment).
</I>
BerliOS is very fine for most projects and it has been working quite
well for us. What I am mainly saying is that when you need more
elaborated management tools, it is less satisfactory. And as the
mailing-list guy I have seen a few issues (nothing extremely bad
though).

&gt;<i> We could also set up a Mantis... I'm willing to donate the Space and
</I>&gt;<i> bandwith (I've got a root server for my SpiritualDesign business anyway
</I>&gt;<i> which is mostly idle). I suppose, traffic/load shouldn't be too much
</I>&gt;<i> (traffic is unlimited anyway for me, it will just be limited to 10
</I>&gt;<i> MBit/s if I get over 1 TB IIRC.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've got all infrastructure in place (Apache, PHP, MySQL, Mail, Backup
</I>&gt;<i> etc.), so you're welcome. I've got no mailing list setup yet though and
</I>&gt;<i> it's probably too much for me to administer/provide.
</I>
Thanks a lot (really) for the offer, but I'd prefer something hosted
where minimal investment is required if possible.

I'm not a huge fan of Mantis (already tried).

&gt;<i> JIRA is Java stuff, right? I don't feel like maintaining that, either,
</I>&gt;<i> although we've got a lot of Tomcats running and administered at work.
</I>
Yep, JIRA needs a Java web container.

&gt;<i> If it's only bug tracking: Keep BerliOS, setup own Bug Tracker (which
</I>&gt;<i> could be really customized to our needs then). You control izforge.com,
</I>&gt;<i> so we could add a DNS name bugs.izforge.com, possibly with own MX and
</I>&gt;<i> own mail adresses.
</I>
I want more than a bug tracker, I want a tool for true project
management, and JIRA fits this nicely. In Python there is Trac which I
like a lot (and use in our research group). Its project management
features are not as complete as JIRA, but it can already do a lot.

Cheers
</PRE>
