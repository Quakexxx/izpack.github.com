<PRE>Hi everyone,

I've been thinking a bit about the project infrastructure recently. I
would like to discuss with you on the website and the developers
services.

// Web site //

I'm a bit bored with it. I opted for a wiki-style software, but it is
not that efficient after all. People don't use the free wiki section
that much, and I have to revert frequent spamming attacks.

I'm thinking of changing to a Wordpress install with lighter pages so
as to provide a better communication.

// Developer services //

Let me start with a bit of history ;-)

I started the project in 2001 and a few months later, I decided to put
it on a CVS server. I chose TuxFamily, a french association to host
it. Things went well until their servers became seriously attacked. We
could restore the CVS history but had to move to another place (for
the record, TuxFamily is alive again, but it took them a year or so to
get back on track).

BerliOS was an excellent choice: like SourceForge but way smaller.
Since then, we've been happily using their infrastructure, even moving
from CVS to SVN. They are hosting most of the developer services:
releases, mailing-lists, SVN, ... The team behind the servers is quite
nice and frankly... there's not much to complain given the price that
we pay ;-)

BerliOS has however a few glitches:
* frequent outages (e.g., last week the emails were blocked on the
mailing-lists for 2-3 days because of spam experiments...)
* really inconvenient bug/tasks trackers.... (e.g., this is why we ask
people to report on the list!).
The later point is really critical: I would like to have better tools
for the project management.

I've been looking around for possible options.
* Tigris, Java.net: they use CollabNet which is no better here (even
some people at Sun complain of having to use this...)
* SourceForge: too big, no better tools than BerliOS
* Google Code: (too?) simple, SVN quota is already too small and the
file downloads quota is limitating (we won't be able to release from
there)
* Gna, Savannah: same codebase as BerliOS/SourceForge, and restricted
to GPL fans
* Apache: lots of good tools, but the project needs to be donated then
incubated there (and it looks like there is some bureaucracy)
* Codehaus: they are selective, but they offer many great Atlassian
products (JIRA, Confluence, FishEye, ...) and they also have licenses
for some nice tools (Clover, etc)
* rent a virtualized server: we could do everything there, but it
costs money and it requires a lot of administration.

I've been playing with an evaluation license of JIRA: this tool would
be just great for managing efficiently the project (roadmap, tasks,
RFEs, bugs, ...). The tool is available free for opensource projects,
but I don't feel like maintaining a server for it. Apache and Codehaus
have JIRA instances.

One possible solution would be to move the developer services to
Codehaus: SVN, downloads, mailing-lists, JIRA, wiki. The
infrastructure looks like to be very good (I've discussed this a lot
with the Groovy project leader which I know).

What do you think the best option would be? Should I talk with the
Codehaus people? Do you have a better plan?

I'm really open on this and looking forward to hear your comments ;-)

Cheers
</PRE>
