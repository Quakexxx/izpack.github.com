<PRE>I noticed a recent commit was to remove a System.out and wanted to pose a
question.  How is console output and logging viewed by everyone?  I added
quite a few System.out statements to my code so I could run the installer
via the command line and get the relevant console output to trace what was
going on.  I left many of the statements in just because I foresee having
customers calling about issues which could be troubleshot much easier by
having them run their install from the command line and sending in the
console output.  Without a fully integrated logging mechanism, this is
really the only choice I have.  I have a desire to attack logging here, but
obviously there won't be anything substantial in the near term.  So what are
your thoughts?  Running the installer as most users would hides all the
console output and auto-installs aren't affected by it...  Any objections to
Log4j?
