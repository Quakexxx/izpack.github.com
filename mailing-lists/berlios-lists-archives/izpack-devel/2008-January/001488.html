<PRE>Hi,
in IzPack there are two logger entities and - of course - System.out.
com.izforge.izpack.util.Debug is the old one,
com.izforge.izpack.util.Log the newer one.
Why two logger? Because some one would have a little bit other logger (
Elmar and I), but it will be not good to addapt all old calls to the new
one and remove the old one because some user used it in it private code.
We cannot simple change an existent API.
Both classes are described in the JavaDoc. Not to much, I know...
Both classes are able to log to a file. 
The method Log.informUser will be called from FinishPanel or
SimpleFinishPanel. If an Error or a Warning was stored a MessageBox will
be openend a ask to dump to a file or not.
 
We do not use the really good tool Log4j in IzPack core because it will
enlarge the IzPack core to much.
 
Cheers
 
Klaus

	I hadn't used any of the logging facilities because of many
other messages stating how the logging was broken.  I've used Log4j for
about 10 years now and I think it has pretty much become the industry
standard, but there are many folks who prefer other things, and that's
fine.  I would just like to have a way to log the installation to a
file.
