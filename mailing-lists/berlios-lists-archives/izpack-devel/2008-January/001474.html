<PRE>Hi Jeff,

&gt;<i> I noticed a recent commit was to remove a System.out and wanted to pose a
</I>&gt;<i> question.  How is console output and logging viewed by everyone?  I added
</I>&gt;<i> quite a few System.out statements to my code so I could run the installer
</I>&gt;<i> via the command line and get the relevant console output to trace what was
</I>&gt;<i> going on.  I left many of the statements in just because I foresee having
</I>&gt;<i> customers calling about issues which could be troubleshot much easier by
</I>&gt;<i> having them run their install from the command line and sending in the
</I>&gt;<i> console output.  Without a fully integrated logging mechanism, this is
</I>&gt;<i> really the only choice I have.  I have a desire to attack logging here, but
</I>&gt;<i> obviously there won't be anything substantial in the near term.  So what are
</I>&gt;<i> your thoughts?  Running the installer as most users would hides all the
</I>&gt;<i> console output and auto-installs aren't affected by it...  Any objections to
</I>&gt;<i> Log4j?
</I>
The System.out.println that I have removed was causing systematic
spurious &quot;log [null]&quot; messages to be displayed.

There have been a few discussions regarding logging in the past (you
can dig the archives to find it). Maybe others like Klaus and Elmar
can comment here.

Finally as far as log4j is concerned, I would prefer java.util.logging
since it is already bundled in the JDK API and does a very fine job
;-)

Cheers
</PRE>
