<PRE>Hi,
first, on Windows IzPack is able to detect a allready installed product.
See CheckedHelloPanel. But you mean the detection of just running more
than one installer, I think. On a system where we can use a thing like
the registry it is simple.
On Windows you can search for a regkey which was created under HKCU in
the constructor of the calling panel, Little bit difficult to guarantee
removing, but not the biggest problem.
Other Applications as Eclipse or MSI can store a &quot;semaphore&quot;-file in its
own path area. IzPack has no own subtree.
May be we can use a common existent path to create a &quot;semaphore&quot;-file,
but this will be difficult. Until now it is not in the IzPack core.
 
Cheers
 
Klaus

	I haven't done this with Java.  I know Eclipse and some other
applications do this, but was wondering if there was an easy way to
implement it.  My experience has been that each Java application blindly
launches in a new JVM with no way to check in an OS neutral way whether
an instance of the same application is already running.

		&gt; Sorry for not searching old message on this, but I've
got an immediate

the installer again).

default behavior to

		Good idea, just make sure it checks on the installation
instance and
