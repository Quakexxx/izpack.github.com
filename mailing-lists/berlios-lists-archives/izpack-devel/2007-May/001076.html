<PRE>Hi again,

Sorry if my initial message was abrasive. I actually
think IzPack is a good product, or else I wouldn't be
using it at all.

Many thanks to those who pointed out the way to create
custom langpacks. I would maybe add a link to the
&lt;resources&gt; section from the &lt;locale&gt; section of the
docs. The best documentation is the one that requires
the least reading (likewise, the best products are
those that can be used without documentation).

To the people who got offended: many thanks (and
congratulations!)  for developing a product that works
*so well* that my only complaint was about
localization. Not about crashes, or lost data, mind
you, but about localization...

Now, if you haven't tuned me out by this time, bear
with me a little more. First of all, I have developed
open-source software myself, so I am aware of the
&quot;volunteering&quot; aspect. But even if open-source is not
payed for, it's still the case that

1) there's an end-user whose needs should be
first-priority. Just because there's no boss doesn't
mean we should ignore the needs of the intended
audience. Doing so only gets us p***ed-off users and
negative press, and I don't think that's what we aim
for.

2) we should strive for good quality, for the simple
reason that every product is a showcase of our skills
and workmanship.

I hope I am in agreement with most people on these
points. Some open source developers seem to believe
that (1) doesn't apply to them, but I think that's a
mistaken philosophy.

Most criticism has a constructive component. This was
the intended meaning, or else I wouldn't have bothered
to subscribe to this list &amp; write a message.

Peace,
Dan
