<PRE>Hi Julien,

See context related:


&gt;<i> From the website they have you will mostly grab the syntax (which is 
</I>&gt;<i> easy).
</I>
Saw that and I agree. Looks simple enough to me :)

&gt;<i> The thing is that there are many many generated ids, code and stuff
</I>&gt;<i> like that and I find it harder to handle when you need a change. In
</I>&gt;<i> the short term it is always easy to make a small change, but in the
</I>&gt;<i> long run it may not be the best bet :-)
</I>
I couldn't agree more. I could however fix the current XHTML if needed.

&gt;<i> Yes. Basically, they provide a set of Python programs that can make
</I>&gt;<i> the transformations:
</I>&gt;<i> rst2html, rst2latex (then you can run pdflatex) and so on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you have a more elaborated structure than a single file, you can
</I>&gt;<i> write a simple Python program as well, since 'docutils' is actually  a
</I>&gt;<i> Python module. For example the Django Project manage its documentation
</I>&gt;<i> this way:
</I>&gt;<i> - 1 file = 1 chapter
</I>&gt;<i> - they have custom script to put it all together and write the output.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Python being very portable, the whole thing is quite trivial to do.
</I>
I don't know Python (always willing to learn and help though...) but If you 
say so... I trust you :)

Ok, I think that if we can make the Python (or anything else) script 
dynamically ran from Ant during compilation that would be perfect.

One other point (but I think you already answered it): Is the HTML Generated 
XHTML Strict Valid ? Having to parse it after generation to clean it up 
would be a bit of pain.

&gt;<i> What do you think? As I said previously, I am volunteering to create
</I>&gt;<i> the generation scripts and make the migration to reST files.
</I>
My point of view is that we should go for it as long as it matches the 
requirements mentioned above and of course if our dev team/community is up 
for it.

I can help you to build it too.

Cheers,
Fabrice
