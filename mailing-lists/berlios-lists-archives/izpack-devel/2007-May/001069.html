<PRE>Hi devels,

a small complaint: I'm not happy with the default
langpacks (eng.xml, for example). Here are two things
that would help:

1) let the user specify a custom location for a
langpack. I want to create my own custom_eng.xml and
use it via

&lt;locale&gt;
&lt;langpack iso3=&quot;custom_eng&quot;
  location=&quot;/path/to/my/langpack&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/locale&gt;

2) Long-term, please try to improve the quality of the
langpacks. In particular, with respect to eng.xml

* keep in mind that my customers are installing MY
product, not IzPack. MY product is the hero, not
IzPack. While I understand your desire for credit, the
generated installer should mention IzPack sparringly,
so as not to confuse the end-users. A small footnote
saying &quot;This installer was created with IzPack&quot; should
suffice.

* read <A HREF="http://alt-usage-english.org/humorousrules.html">http://alt-usage-english.org/humorousrules.html</A>

* exclamation marks look childish! and alarmistic! A
colon (.) is preferrable most of the times.

* the suggestion to &quot;refer to your operating system
manual&quot; will not go down well with customers. Come to
think of it, when is the last time you saw an &quot;OS
manual&quot;? My guess is that this comes from DOS days.
Simply stating failure would be enough.

* a file or directory can't be &quot;not appropriate&quot; (what
does that mean, anyway?)

* awkward messages like these that add to the overall
poor quality impression and discourage adoption of
IzPack. When possible, please have someone fluent in
English (preferrably a non-geek!) review the
langpacks.

Thanks!
Dan
