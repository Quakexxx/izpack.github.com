<PRE>differ between the different versions of Windows (Rundll32, shutdown,
...)

Anyway, I don't know much about creating panels and so on, as it is
the first time I try IzPack. By-the-way, it is a really great tool!

Let me take advantage of this post to make a few comments. My point is
to give my opinion as a dumb user that saw IzPack for the first time.
Hopefully my experience/comments will be of some use for you guys :)

Let's start:
- When I run it in Java 6, it would be nice that labels that display
URLs turn into links, which when clicked use the Desktop API (if
available)
- It was not straightforward for me to understand that to override the
title of the installer, the CustomLangpack.xml_&lt;ISO&gt; was actually the
id to use in the resources (and not the name of the file to place in
some specific IzPack directory).
- It would be nice if we could define a path for the lookup of the
listeners, maybe we can and I couldn't find how. Nevertheless, my ant
script generates the listener jars that I need, place them to the
expected IzPack directory, runs IzPack, and then deletes the Jars...
- Wouldn't it be possible that panels define a default image, which
would be automatically used when the ImgPacksPanel is used but when
images are not defined?
- I had to write a listener that modifies the registry. It was weird
that I had to include in my project &quot;RegistryInstallerListener.jar&quot;
since it is itself a listener. I thought the core registry access
files would be in standalone-compiler.jar or some different file named
for example win-registry.jar.
- Maybe the handling of the Windows registry should be specified in
the documentation. I got everything working mainly by looking at the
sources of the RegistryInstaller, but in theory it would be nice to
have a few lines that say &quot;include that particular Jar, use the
RegistryDefaultHandler.getInstance() and then use the RegistryHandler
to get/set/create/delete paths and values&quot;. Javadoc there is also
limited and I had to apply trial and error to see if for example an
exception is thrown when you try to delete a non-existant key.
- As you know I miss the reboot screen. What I need to specify though,
is that it would also be needed at uninstall time. Posting an event
for deletion when the computer has restarted could be interesting, but
I don't know how that works. Maybe putting a value in &quot;runonce&quot; in the
registry that looks something like &quot;cmd.exe /c del
the\path\to\the\file&quot; would do the trick. For my reboot problem, I may
create a listener that shows a JOptionPane just to tell the user he
should restart. If it were a panel, then that panel should be shown
conditionally on the selection of some of the packs (since only one
pack actually needs that reboot).
- Is there a way to know in an uninstall listener what packs were
installed? So that I would display my JOptionPane telling the user to
reboot only if my special native pack was installed?
- I don't know how easy it is to define a custom L&amp;F for the
installer, how it should be declared, how to bundle it, etc.
- I don't know if it is possible to customize the icon of the IzPack frame.

hm, that was a long list actually. I wonder if someone will have the
courage to reach that line :)

Cheers,
-Christopher
