<PRE>Hi Loic,

&gt;<i> For quite some time now I have been offerring you my help to get this
</I>&gt;<i> new documentation fnished as soon as possible. This offer is still
</I>&gt;<i> valid, should you want to accept it.
</I>
Sure! I'll get back to you on the list when the documentation is ready
to be edited and I have added the building scripts.

&gt;<i> However, can I request once more that my patches first submitted in
</I>&gt;<i> october 2006 (Localization of InstallationGroupPanel) and in April 2007
</I>&gt;<i> (resubmit of the previous one + Localization of shortcuts) be reviewed
</I>&gt;<i> and merged before 3.11.0 gets out ? I just checked out latest SVN and
</I>&gt;<i> noticed that it is still not done.
</I>&gt;<i> For the latest it is strange because Klaus had reviewed &amp; merged it
</I>&gt;<i> (check his mail from 27.04.07), I had checked that it worked, but
</I>&gt;<i> obviously it has been erased since then... (I mailed the list regarding
</I>&gt;<i> this on 26.06.07).
</I>&gt;<i> The first one has, to my knowledge, never been merged.
</I>
This is a very strange story as it had been merged... I'll have a look again.

Cheers
</PRE>
