<PRE>Hi Marc,

I do object. This is against the very important principles of information
hiding.

I am not sure which fields you want to access from your subclass. I would
strongly advise to find other approaches to solve your problem. Writing
subclasses with detailed knowledge of the inside workings of the super
class, such as data fields, is never a good idea. This is particularly true
in such a disconnected case as you present. If we ever make changes to those
data fields or how we use them, anyone who wrote a subclass will see their
code break. In many cases there will be no obvious indication of that fact.

Instead we should strive to have a clean and dependable interface that
subclasses can really depend on.

	Elmar

Subject: [izpack-devel] private to protected


Hi all,

I want to change the fields and methods of the UserInputPanel from private
to
protected, to make it possible to derive an userdefined UserInputPanel from
it. If there is nobody which has an objection about it, I will commit this
next week at Tuesday. Then I will describe and document the features(** of
my
derived ExtendedUserInputPanel and if there is anybody that interests on, I
will commit this.

**) such as userdefined Title Layouts.

Cheers
Marc
