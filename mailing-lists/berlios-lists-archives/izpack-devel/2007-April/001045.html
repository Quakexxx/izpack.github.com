<PRE>Hi All,

I made the mistake of updating the XML files before being told they're 
no longer being used, and that the HTML files are the ones to update. 
Doesn't it make sense to go ahead and 'svn rm' the unused XML help files?

On the wiki subject, I don't know if that would help much if you still 
limit the people who can update it as you do with the svn. You could 
just update the web from the svn automatically on a regular basis. If 
you did do the wiki, perhaps it would make sense to do as PostgreSQL 
does with their web docs: some can update the actual docs, but all can 
add comments at the bottom of each page. They post each version's docs 
and you can view them online with or without comments, or download a 
PDF. I've added comments before, but I don't know how they do their main 
updates. I'd guess they use some open source system, but it's not 
immediately obvious what that is. It seems like a good system, but I 
don't know how difficult it is to set up.

By the way, I submitted the attached patch to node9.html a couple of 
months ago and it doesn't look like it ever got applied. If it got 
overlooked, I understand how that can happen. If there's a problem with 
it, I'd like to get some feedback as to why it wasn't correct or suitable.

Scott

See: <A HREF="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/manuals/">http://www.postgresql.org/docs/manuals/</A>

P.S. Patch created with 'svn diff -r HEAD node9.html 
 &gt;/tmp/node9.html.patch'
Please let me know if that isn't the best way to submit them.

P.S.S. Thanks for the new izpack.org domain--it's a great thing for the 
community.
