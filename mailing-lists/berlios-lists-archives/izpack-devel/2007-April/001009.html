<PRE>Hi all,
in the moment I am working at the langpacks.
Some weeks ago we have discussed it a little bit
and decided to change to properties files and remove
flags.
In the moment I have an converter from our HTML format
to properties format ready. I use a HTML helper from
Elmar which uses the standard stuff.
Not all old HTML files are convertable because some
contains bad utf-8 sequences. E.g. ukr.xml.


The properties file format is ugly to read for chars 
other than ASCII, e.g.:
English:
installer.warning=Warning\!
Turkish:
installer.warning=Uyar\u00C3\u00BD\!
Japanese:
installer.warning=\u8B66\u544A \!

I think this is not editable. Therefore I am writing
a little, simple, ugly tool which shows the text as
seen in the IzPanels and allow to edit it. I do not
implement any way to write the glyphs with an English
mapped keybord, else I assume that the user has the
needed keybord mapping activated. On MS Windows XP
this works better as I have assumed. I have tested it
with RU. I cannot read it, but I can write chars which
looks like some which are present in the converted file.

My votes:
1.
I vote to remove the old stuff (files like eng.xml)
fully and support only properties files beginning with the 
next medium relase(3.11).
The standard langpacks we (I) can convert. Custom langpacks
have to be converted by the install builder with the given 
converter.

2.
I vote to make the bad langpacks public in the user email
list and remove them in the next medium release (3.11),
if they are not corrected. 

Any comments?

Cheers

Klaus
