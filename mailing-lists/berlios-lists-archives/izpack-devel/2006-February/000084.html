<PRE>I was recently working on a series of panels (which I plan to post here when 
they're ready for possible inclusion, since I think others will find them 
helpful) and used the PathSelectionPanel.  I needed access to the Browse 
button so I could do something slightly differently with the FileChooser.  
Since the Browse button (browseButton) is private, there was no way to access 
it (I also wanted to get the dimensions so I could put another button under 
it that would be the same size).  I ended up creating another class, 
AlteredPathSelectionPanel and adding just one method that would return the 
button object.  Is there a chance of getting this added to 
PathSelectionPanel:
 
    /**
     * Returns the browse button object for modification or for use with a
     * different ActionListener.
     * 
     * @return the browse button to open the JFileChooser
     */
    public JButton getBrowseButton()
    {
    	return browseButton;
    }

I don't know how much it would be used, but it would be helpful.

Thanks!

Hal
