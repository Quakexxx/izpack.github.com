<PRE>I'm not really sure, but we already have this refpack-feature, which gives us the possibility to reference packs which are described in separate xml files.
What would be the great benefit of a XInclude implementation?

Regards,

Betreff: Re: [izpack-devel] Adding XInclude support

Hmm that wasn't particularly clear,

I'm not asking anyone to add the support for me, I've been given time at work to do that. The company I work for (www.volantis.com) is in the process of making a large chunk of their code open source. As part of this we are changing the installer we use from InstallAnywhere to IzPack (generating the installer is part of the build process of the code being opened).

I've pretty much finished an implementation of XInclude but would like someone from the IzPack developers community to answer the questions I posted previously so the addition will cause the least offence.

cheers

Matt

Subject: Adding XInclude support

Hi all,

I'm looking at adding support for a subset of the XInclude
 specification (<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/">http://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/</A>) to IzPack. 

To make a few projects of mine a bit more modular and maintainable I
 think it would be useful to allow parts of the 
xml files used by IzPack to be included from other files (and yes I've
 tried using external entities but they are a bit limited
for my needs)

The current code is based on a copy of the StdXMLBuilder class that has
 been modified to allow extending classes access to its internal state.

Note that this will not be a full implementation of the XInclude spec
 (I don't have time right now to handle the XPointer stuff properly)

So some questions: 

a) Is a change like this likely to be accepted?
b) namespace support seems really limited in nanoxml when used in
 IzPack. I'm not seeing any. Am I missing something?
c) Is it preferable to make changes to the nanoxml packages or the
 izPack packages. I'm asking because it makes little difference to the
code and many people prefer to keep third party source as original as
 possible.


Cheers

Matt
