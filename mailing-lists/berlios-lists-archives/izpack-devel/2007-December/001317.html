<PRE>Hi Julien,

XInclude is designed by committee so yes it probably is overkill :)

Lack of namespace support will mean that the include element will be hardcoded in the xml parser. It won't be 
able to be used for anything else :( I don't think that this is a particularly large problem for izpack though.

So, if I do this two elements &lt;include&gt; and &lt;fragment&gt; will become reserved element names (actually there is a 
third called &lt;fallback&gt; which will also have special meaning but only within an include element.


Cheers

Matt

Subject: Re: [izpack-devel] Adding XInclude support

Hi Matt,

&gt;<i> a) Is a change like this likely to be accepted?
</I>
Yes, although XInclude may be too big for the task, and ...

&gt;<i> b) namespace support seems really limited in nanoxml when used in
</I> IzPack. I'm not seeing any. Am I missing something?

... nanoxml doesn't indeed support namespaces.

&gt;<i> c) Is it preferable to make changes to the nanoxml packages or the
</I> izPack packages. I'm asking because it makes little difference to the
&gt;<i> code and many people prefer to keep third party source as original as
</I> possible.

NanoXML is not developed anymore, so you can make changes there if you
want. The thing is to make it lightweight enough.

Or maybe a &lt;include (...)&gt; style tag would be just enough?

Cheers
