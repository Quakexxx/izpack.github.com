<PRE>Hi Matthew,

+1 this makes more sense.

&gt;<i> b) I would also like to make a small modification to the parsing of

</I>&gt;<i> xml type).
</I>
+1 sounds like a useful feature. Maybe, it's more sensible to introduce
an extra tag for the preparsing - the parse type attribute currently
specifies what to do at install time, so it is not obvious that some
special value will change this. Having a new attribute would also allow
to process this at compile and install time...

Bye,

Tino.
