<PRE>Hi Dennis,

I wasn't aware of the ref-pack feature. It appears to do part of what I need however I also need to be able to include panels/fields into the userInputSpec.xml (does IzPack use nanoXML to parse this (I haven't checked yet)) and to perform other insertions into the install.xml.

Basically the software consists of a number of products that, ideally, should each know how to install themselves. However I need to be able to build  &quot;meta&quot; installers that can grab information (packs, User input, licenses etc) from these individual products and assemble them into a single multi-product installer where each product ends up as one or more packs in the final installer.

I'm not sure if XInclude is the best way to do this but at the moment it seems to meet many of my requirements.

Cheers

Matt

Subject: Re: [izpack-devel] Adding XInclude support

I'm not really sure, but we already have this refpack-feature, which
 gives us the possibility to reference packs which are described in
 separate xml files.
What would be the great benefit of a XInclude implementation?

Regards,

Betreff: Re: [izpack-devel] Adding XInclude support

Hmm that wasn't particularly clear,

I'm not asking anyone to add the support for me, I've been given time
 at work to do that. The company I work for (www.volantis.com) is in the
 process of making a large chunk of their code open source. As part of
 this we are changing the installer we use from InstallAnywhere to IzPack
 (generating the installer is part of the build process of the code
 being opened).

I've pretty much finished an implementation of XInclude but would like
 someone from the IzPack developers community to answer the questions I
 posted previously so the addition will cause the least offence.

cheers

Matt

Subject: Adding XInclude support

Hi all,

I'm looking at adding support for a subset of the XInclude
 specification (<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/">http://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/</A>) to IzPack. 

To make a few projects of mine a bit more modular and maintainable I
 think it would be useful to allow parts of the 
xml files used by IzPack to be included from other files (and yes I've
 tried using external entities but they are a bit limited
for my needs)

The current code is based on a copy of the StdXMLBuilder class that has
 been modified to allow extending classes access to its internal state.

Note that this will not be a full implementation of the XInclude spec
 (I don't have time right now to handle the XPointer stuff properly)

So some questions: 

a) Is a change like this likely to be accepted?
b) namespace support seems really limited in nanoxml when used in
 IzPack. I'm not seeing any. Am I missing something?
c) Is it preferable to make changes to the nanoxml packages or the
 izPack packages. I'm asking because it makes little difference to the
code and many people prefer to keep third party source as original as
 possible.


Cheers

Matt
