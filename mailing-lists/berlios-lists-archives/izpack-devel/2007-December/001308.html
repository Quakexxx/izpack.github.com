<PRE>Hi all,

I'm looking at adding support for a subset of the XInclude specification (<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/">http://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/</A>) to IzPack. 

To make a few projects of mine a bit more modular and maintainable I think it would be useful to allow parts of the 
xml files used by IzPack to be included from other files (and yes I've tried using external entities but they are a bit limited
for my needs)

The current code is based on a copy of the StdXMLBuilder class that has been modified to allow extending classes access to its internal state.

Note that this will not be a full implementation of the XInclude spec (I don't have time right now to handle the XPointer stuff properly)

So some questions: 

a) Is a change like this likely to be accepted?
b) namespace support seems really limited in nanoxml when used in IzPack. I'm not seeing any. Am I missing something?
c) Is it preferable to make changes to the nanoxml packages or the izPack packages. I'm asking because it makes little difference to the
code and many people prefer to keep third party source as original as possible.


Cheers

Matt
