<PRE>Hi Tino,

Perhaps you could clarify somthing for me. I was looking at the code for CompilerConfig#addResources (<A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/izpack/izpack-src/trunk/src/lib/com/izforge/izpack/compiler/CompilerConfig.java">http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/izpack/izpack-src/trunk/src/lib/com/izforge/izpack/compiler/CompilerConfig.java</A>)
In that file it appears that the &quot;parse&quot; attribute (on a &quot;res&quot; element) causes variable substitution to occur at compile 
time (sorry I don't have an IDE to help me track through the code at the moment to see if this is really the case).

As to having a seperate attribute that causes an xml file to be fully parsed (by nanoXml) at compile 
time; I mostly agree that it should be a seperate attribute (or perhaps change the &quot;parse&quot; attribute 
so it has the options &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot; and &quot;xml&quot;). However I am a bit confused wrt the content of the previous paragraph.

If &quot;parse='yes'&quot; causes compile time variable substitution then perhaps a type=&quot;parsexml&quot; would be more suitable.
If &quot;parse='yes'&quot; causes install time variable substitution then a new attribute or modification of the 'parse' attribute 
would be more appicable.

Cheers

Hi Matthew,

+1 this makes more sense.

</I>
+1 sounds like a useful feature. Maybe, it's more sensible to introduce
an extra tag for the preparsing - the parse type attribute currently
specifies what to do at install time, so it is not obvious that some
special value will change this. Having a new attribute would also allow
to process this at compile and install time...

Bye,

Tino.
