<PRE>It sounds like you have similar problems to myself.

Yep, I've been down the magic comments route. Some times it's the most suitable approach 
and we still use them for some stuff. However since I am currently involved in creating a new 
build/install system for a number of older products I thought it might be nice to use tools (like IzPack) 
that would enable me to do away with magic comments (although I think we'll still be left with some).

Actually the maigc comments weren't too bad when we where using ant (although we didn't use 
them for installers (have you ever seen the xml file that InstallAnywhere creates?)) but under maven 
they are turning out to be a bit of a pain in the arse.

The xinclude code allows you to specify fallbacks if the specified href can not be found. This fallback can 
actually be an empty element in which case the entire xinclude just disappears (and does not fail). This may
address some of your issues wrt including varying numbers of modules (if you can structure it correctly).


cheers

Hi Matthew,

I don't have an IzPack/IDE setup there, currently, so I'm just trying
 to
remember stuff. I mixed this up with the &lt;parsable&gt; tag where parsing
happens at installation time. 

Yes, the above code parses at compile time. I would opt for introducing
an &quot;parsexml&quot; attribute which is independent of the parse attribute.
This way the user has freedom of choice: No parsing, just XML parsing
(=including), just variable parsing or both.

Hm, this xinclude stuff may be useful for me as well - we're currently
using a wrapper script to substitute some magic comments by XML
 snippets.
On the other hand, we'd still need to substitute the magic comments by
appropiate &lt;xinclude&gt; tags since the number of modules may vary...

Bye+Thanks for the work,

Tino.
