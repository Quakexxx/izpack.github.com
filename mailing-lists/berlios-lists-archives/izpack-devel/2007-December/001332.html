<PRE>Hi Tino,
Thanks for the prompt reply.

Im having simlar kinds of problems. The xinclude mostly helps but does have limitations. 

The &quot;xinclude&quot; element is recursive such that included documents/fragments are also processed and 
thier &quot;xinclude&quot;s are included. I'm planning, primarily, on using it in this context.

So I'm hoping your second suggestion is sufficient for my needs as the first would require a fairly large chunk of 
rework inside izpack (as you noted the xinclude stuff I wrote is in the parser and does not interact with izpack
in any way and therefore cannot have access to the variable/properties defined in izpack install files) while the second 
seems to currently work with the xinclude stuff.

I have been considering adding something like &quot;foreach&quot; and  possibly some conditional processing. However I am not 
sure that it would be that useful. If I added it then it would likely be added to the xml parser and therefore would not have 
access to izpack variables/properties. There is probably some w3c standard I can bastardise to handle this but I'm not 
sure if it is worth it.

Another problem I am currently having is realted to the &quot;pack&quot; element. I can quite easily include packs (using pack-ref or xinclude)
but thier &quot;required&quot; attribute is causing issues. Product 'B' includes product 'A'. As such Product 'B'  xincludes/pack-refs a number of
packs from product 'A'. Product 'A' has a &quot;pack&quot; element that is marked as required, however for product 'B' that pack is optional.

Any ideas?


cheers
matfud

Hi Matthew,

</I>
Solving this &quot;nicely&quot; would require some sophisticated macro stuff. In
my case, we've got a product which is composed of modules (some of them
are mandatory and always there). The point is, I don't know what
 modules
are there or may be there in the future. Therefore I've got a script in
the core module which takes a list of modules to include in the
installer. The script knows where to find the appropiate XML snippets
and includes them.

The XML inclusion for know only happens in two files (installer.xml and
compilationSpec.xml). To automate this or replace by a single
 statement,
I'd need some foreach macro, like this:
a) &lt;xinclude foreach_var=&quot;module&quot; foreach_list=&quot;$modulelist&quot;
    href=&quot;../../$module/config/installer.xml&quot; /&gt;
or
b) &lt;foreach var=&quot;module&quot; values=&quot;$modulelist&quot;&gt;
  &lt;xinclude href=&quot;../../$module/config/installer.xml&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/foreach&gt;

Hm, doesn't sound too complicated to implement. (Note that I've never
looked at the XInclude specs!) Either way, NanoXML couldn't handle the
xinclude tag any more since it wouldn't know the value of $module.
But it shouldn't be too hard to add a preprocessing step to the
 compiler
(variables would have to be passed by command line or we get a
chicken-and-egg problem) to resolve foreach loops and alter the
 document
structure accordingly.

While I'm thinking this through, it doesn't sound easy any more. :-|

Another approach would be to include an XML which includes other XMLs:
&lt;xinclude href=&quot;modules.xml&quot;/&gt;
Then we could generate modules.xml like this:
&lt;xinclude href=&quot;../../module1/config/installer.xml&quot; /&gt;
&lt;xinclude href=&quot;../../module2/config/installer.xml&quot; /&gt;

This would also work for resources and should be easier to create using
ant or maven...

Bye,

Tino.
