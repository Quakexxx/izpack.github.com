<PRE>Well here it is.

It looks like a lot of files but most are just test cases.

The actual code is in XIncludeXMLBuilder that extends the StdXMLBuilder. 

StdXMLBuilder has been modified to allow extending classes access to its state.

A little factory (XMLBuilderFactory) has been created that creates the builder and all places where
new StdXMLBuilder was use have be modified to use the XMLBuilderFactory
builder have been replaced with usage

The reserved elements are 
&lt;xinclude&gt;
&lt;xfragment&gt;

Subject: Re: [izpack-devel] Adding XInclude support

Hi Matt,

&gt;<i> a) Is a change like this likely to be accepted?
</I>
Yes, although XInclude may be too big for the task, and ...

&gt;<i> b) namespace support seems really limited in nanoxml when used in
</I> IzPack. I'm not seeing any. Am I missing something?

... nanoxml doesn't indeed support namespaces.

&gt;<i> c) Is it preferable to make changes to the nanoxml packages or the
</I> izPack packages. I'm asking because it makes little difference to the
&gt;<i> code and many people prefer to keep third party source as original as
</I> possible.

NanoXML is not developed anymore, so you can make changes there if you
want. The thing is to make it lightweight enough.

Or maybe a &lt;include (...)&gt; style tag would be just enough?

Cheers
