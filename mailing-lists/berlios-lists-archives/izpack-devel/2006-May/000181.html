<PRE>I sent this to the user list by mistake a few weeks ago.  Since I had no 
response, I'm re-sending it on this list.

When I create an install for a client, I have one pack (on the web 
install) that is always unique.  I also have 4 other packs, 2 of 
OpenOffice (1 Linux, 1 Windows), and 2 of RealVNC (again, 1 Linux, 1 
Windows).  The OpenOffice packs take 8-10 minutes to compile and 
create.  These packs are the same for each client, so once they're 
created the 1st time for the first client, there is no need to 
re-create them.

Is there any way I can compile a web install that is supposed to include 
some packs but without actually compiling them?

I suppose I could hack the code, but it'll be a couple months before I 
get to that.  Is there another way to do it from the command line?

Thanks.

Hal
