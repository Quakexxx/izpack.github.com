<PRE>Hi Hal,
sorry I have made a mistake in my thought. You need no
maintenance IN the installation program else OF the installation
program. 
I have not such a problem because I have the installation not
on a WebServer. 

Cheers

Klaus

</I>&gt;<i>The differences are only one or two bytes in length.  I won't 
</I>&gt;<i>have time 
</I>&gt;<i>to check the time stamp for a while, but I guess I'll just have to 
</I>&gt;<i>assume it will always be the same length.  It is possible, but 
</I>&gt;<i>unlikely, that the length of differences could be a result of the 
</I>&gt;<i>encryption stream I'm using, but then it should only effect the pack 
</I>&gt;<i>I'm encrypting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I don't know if my situation is unique, but I have to prepare 
</I>&gt;<i>a separate 
</I>&gt;<i>install for each of my clients, since one pack includes individualized 
</I>&gt;<i>passwords for each client.  That means each time I get a new client, I 
</I>&gt;<i>have to create a new web install and standard install, upload the web 
</I>&gt;<i>install and put the standard install on a CD.  Since I have two large 
</I>&gt;<i>packs, that means it takes a long time to upload.  What I was thinking 
</I>&gt;<i>about doing was uploading the two big packs, using symlinks so I had 
</I>&gt;<i>only one copy of each big pack, and not uploading a new copy until 
</I>&gt;<i>something in the pack changed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>At this point I think I'm going to be using rdiff to upload a 
</I>&gt;<i>patch file 
</I>&gt;<i>containing only the differences.
