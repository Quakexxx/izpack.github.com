Hi Markus,

...

I might think to use this feature but I prefer guideline: &quot;keep it
simple&quot;. This switch breaks only a bit the logical usage of the
software. Using this switch won't disturb one person, but person who
travels around to install software into computers different regional
settings configured might think that there is some odd in this
installer: it seems to work differently in some cases... But RTFM will
help here... :-)

--&gt; Well yes, agreed. This is a good point. It might be curious for a
user if the installer behaves different on some systems. 


Regards,
Ari
