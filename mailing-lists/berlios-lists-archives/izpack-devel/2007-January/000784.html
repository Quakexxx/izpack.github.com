<PRE>I think, a knowledgebase is a good idea and suggest to use the wiki on
the izpack homepage.

&gt;<i> Hi everyone,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I wanted to let you all know about a strange experience I just had during an
</I>&gt;<i> installation and a related experience some time ago. Perhaps it can help
</I>&gt;<i> others to deal with similar issues. BTW The experience some time ago was
</I>&gt;<i> what prompted me to suggest the logging facility, so that users get better
</I>&gt;<i> information if an installation was not entirely successful.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What happened some time ago was, that the properties of a file with the
</I>&gt;<i> extension .cfg seemed to have been changed to read-only, during or
</I>&gt;<i> immediately after installation! As you might guess, later attempts to
</I>&gt;<i> override said file where not successful, which caused problems.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What happened today on a customer's machine, was again related to a file
</I>&gt;<i> with the same extension. This file is a plain text file. After installation
</I>&gt;<i> the result on the customer's machine was not as expected a new version of
</I>&gt;<i> this file, but a *merge* of the prior existing content and the new content!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I should mention, that if you look at the comment for files with this
</I>&gt;<i> extension in the Windows Explorer, it says that it is a configuration file
</I>&gt;<i> for Microsoft Outlook.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I had a brief phone discussion about this incident with Klaus and we both
</I>&gt;<i> agree that either Windows or some kind of daemon installed by Outlook
</I>&gt;<i> perform some 'magic' in the background if a change or new installation to a
</I>&gt;<i> file with this extension is detected.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Suggestion / Request for Comments
</I>&gt;<i> =================================
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I suspect this is hardly the only strange thing that happened during an
</I>&gt;<i> installation, nor do I believe such things are isolated to Windows.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore I was thinking, that a knowledge base about observed install
</I>&gt;<i> related problems might be a helpful thing. It might even help to avoid some
</I>&gt;<i> problems, e.g. if I had known that the extension .cfg could cause this kind
</I>&gt;<i> of trouble, I would never have used it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - what do you think about this suggestion?
</I>&gt;<i> - how could we best establish such a knowledge base for IzPack?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>        Elmar
