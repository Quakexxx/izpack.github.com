Hi Markus,

&gt;<i> 2/6 &quot;loose&quot;-feature fix: pending. The &quot;loose&quot;-feature does simply not 
</I>&gt;<i> work correct without this patch, can not live without this fix.
</I>
I am interested to merge this one, but the last version of the patch did
not apply against the source code. I would be happy to try again if you
could update it. I should have told you, but got stuck by other work
duties then holidays.

Subject: [izpack-devel] Patch 2/6: &quot;loose&quot;-function to work with
relativepaths


The &quot;loose&quot;-Option of Packs worked with absolute file path's, while the
Dokumentation stated, that one should take care of the relative file
path's. I have now included a fix, that stores only the relative
filepath in the serialized data and which restores the filepath at
Installationtime based on the location of the jar-file (and if that
fails the current working directory) and the provided relative path of
the PackFile. With this fix, I am now able to define a privately bundled
JRE as &quot;loose&quot; and provide it with the installer-executable (Launch4j)
on a CD. Clients without a preinstalled JRE use this bundled JRE to
start the installer and the Installer will then copy the JRE into the
installdirectory. 
I can hardly imagine a usecase, where the absolute path to the file at
packaging time should also be used at installation time. So I guess the
old behavior is just a bug. If not, we should discuss how the
&quot;loose&quot;-feature should work.
