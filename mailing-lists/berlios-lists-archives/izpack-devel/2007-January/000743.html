<PRE>&gt;<i> We have mailing-list archives ;-)
</I>
Which have no clue about what bugs, improvements, software versions,  
releases, etc... are ;)

&gt;<i> I admit that it is not as good as using Trac or JIRA for linking stuff
</I>&gt;<i> with SVN, but the BerliOS managers where not convenient. People have
</I>&gt;<i> been sending patches/bugs directly to this list for a few months and
</I>&gt;<i> the least we can say is that we have been more productive than if
</I>&gt;<i> people drop it to the managers...
</I>
I totally understand your point, but I just wanted to stress the fact  
that you might want a better solution ;)
(to take a concrete example, I have no clue wether the patch I sent  
on Dec.14 was ever applied, applied as is, improved or rejected - nor  
do i know in what version it'll be there)

I think using the right tools will help you improve quality and  
processes in general. Ask any woodworker ;) Did you consider changing  
hosting services?

cheers
