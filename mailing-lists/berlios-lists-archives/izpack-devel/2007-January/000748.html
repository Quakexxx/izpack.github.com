<PRE>Well, one point I could imagine as a feature of an other provider is,
that there wouldn't be so much commercials inside (mixed up) the site's
content.
It's really confusing when reading through the site and stumble over the
links to competitors...

&gt;<i> (to take a concrete example, I have no clue wether the patch I sent on
</I>
&gt;<i> Dec.14 was ever applied, applied as is, improved or rejected - nor do 
</I>&gt;<i> i know in what version it'll be there)
</I>
It looks like it did not went through. I suggest that you send it again
against the latest trunk if you can ;-)

I recently registered to the lists using GMail and it improves my
efficiency in tracking/handling patches sent to the list. It works much
better than a silly patches tracker or a traditionnal email client.

&gt;<i> I think using the right tools will help you improve quality and 
</I>&gt;<i> processes in general. Ask any woodworker ;) Did you consider changing 
</I>&gt;<i> hosting services?
</I>
Well this is a fairly complex topic as we have the lists here, the whole
CVS and now SVN history... We have always been well treated here at
BerliOS and other providers don't seem to have a significant features
edge that would justify a move.
