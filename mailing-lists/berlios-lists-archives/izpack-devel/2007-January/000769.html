<PRE>Hi all,
Elmar has written a new logging stuff which supports 
different languages, presents a message to the end user
and so on. Elmar has send the first version of the sources
last December.
There are different slots for errors, warnings and messages.
The message box calling wether the contents should be
written into a file or not will be presented at end of installation.
Now there is additional a debug message slot using different
channels. 
In opposite to other slots I think the debug messages
should be written to stdout or stderr at the time they
will be created. If I debug, I will see messages from step
to step. One question is additional log them later with
the hole stuff or not. 
An other question is how to manage the debugging channels.
I think we can use two ways. As first an xml file in the
installer which can configure it. Experts can then simple
use a spical file at the tests or edit it in the jar file.
As second a commandline option like
-DTRACE=DebugSymbol1,DebugSymbol2,DebugSymbol3 
and so on. I remember that I have voted not to use 
commandline options to configure the installation. Yes,
that's my meaning, but debugging is not a normal usage
of the installation and I have no lust to explain more 
than four times how to edit an xml file in a jar file...

I think it will be good to use it.if exist I will change
the loggings of the classes I have written to this new
stuff.
But we have also an existent logging system with 
com.izforge.izpack.util.Debug
Marc has added and changed something in it last time.
Good for debugging, only channels missing.
My question is, whether we should change all debugging
output to the new one or not. Else we have two classes
for the same thing.

Please comments

Cheers

Klaus
