<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>When you have mixed packs &quot;required&quot; and &quot;not required&quot;, the packs that
are required come grayed out on the PacksPanel which is correct.
 
With the current trunk, when deselecting a pack that is not required,
the packs that are required become colored (not grayed out any more).
I do not have time to take a look at this now. Maybe Dennis could do it?
 
Regards
 
Markus Schlegel
