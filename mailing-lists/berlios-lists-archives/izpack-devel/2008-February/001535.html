<PRE>&gt;<i> There are a few problems with the XInclude code. Some of the changes for it seem to have been overwritten. It relies on the SystemID of the parser being set correctly (to allow relative includes) but this is not done correctly anymore. I will fix this at some point when I have time.

Veru good
