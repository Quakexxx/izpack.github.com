Hi!

I am new at IzPack (3.9.0 version ) and I would appriciate if you could help
me in the following problem.

I want to execute a *.bat file postinstall. The *.bat file contains
different variables, wich after the parsing they are all correctly replaced.
But when the installer tries to execute the *.bat file I receive an error
(process execution failed).

The problem I observed is that when I try to execute the file from where it
was installed, there is no error, it runs corectly. But the installer is
trying to execute the file from the path where is the installer.
For example, the instaler is placed in D:\INSTALLER and the installed
program is placed in C:\TEST. 
Well the *.bat is executed like:

D:\INSTALLER&gt; java &#8211;classpath C:\TEST\something.jar; name_of_java_file var1
var2 &#8230;. varn

I have tried to execute the file using the &lt;executable&gt; command from
install.xml ( &lt;executable targetfile=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH\name_of_bat_file.bat&quot;
failure=&quot;warn&quot; stage=&quot;postinstall&quot;/&gt;) and the &lt;executefile&gt; command form
ProcessPanel.Spec.xml (&lt;executefile
name=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH\name_of_bat_file.bat&quot;/&gt;), but neither of the chioces
worked. In both cases I receive the same error.

So this is my problem and it seems I am doing something wrong, but I can't
see where. If you think you would need more details don&#8217;t hesitate to tell
me and thank you for your time and help.
