<PRE>Hi list,

As mentionned on the user-list, the JDKPathPanel does not work  
properly on MacOSX: it tries to get the parent directory of the  
running vm (idata.getVariable(&quot;JAVA_HOME&quot;), which confusingly  
actually corresponds to System.getProperty(&quot;java.home&quot;)), which makes  
no sense on MacOSX (i.e this will not point to a jdk if we're running  
from a jre). Since I wasn't checking for a minimal version in my  
installer, the installed application just did not work.

Anyways, here's my patch for this. Instead of just trying to find a  
jdk at java.home's parent, it checks
java.home
java.home's parent
JAVA_HOME (the system env. variable)
JAVA_HOME's parent

As you'll see, I had to introduce a pathIsValid(String path) method  
in PathInputPanel, which is actually probably a good thing and should  
help in further separating gui code from logic, and for instance,  
avoids unnecessary calls to         pathSelectionPanel.setPath 
(chosenPath) (lines 126-129 in JDKPathPanel)

Please let me know what you think.

Cheers,

greg
