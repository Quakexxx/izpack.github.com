<PRE>I do not vote to add this patch to IzPack, but I can live with it if so.
 
1. Until now the regular usage of an installations made with IzPack needs 
no command line options. It is more work to write the option as to select
the default language. Additional the user has to know  the option.
May be the usage of a batch or cmd or sh file for starting solves this, but
why. What about international OS installations?
 
A better solution for suppress the language selection feature will be to declare 
it in the &lt;guiprefs&gt;. To save extension of the element it is possible to use
the sub element &lt;modifier&gt;. But without docu this should not be done.
 
 
I warn about to change the default behavior; I will not live with it.
 
2. The language selection dialog is not a bug else a feature of IzPack.
May be there are other state of the art installer where a language selection
needs a calling program which merges an other language into the installation. 
IzPack provides this as feature for all users, not only for the users which reads 
the installation docu where (we hope) it is written how to call the installation to 
get the language selection dialog.
 
It is normal that one loves the daughter and one the mother. Long time ago
a developer of IzPack has decided that there is a language selection dialog.
We should not change this if some one do not like it. Else we start a ping
pong play.
 
Cheers
 
Klaus

Subject: [izpack-devel] Patch 5/6: Language From OS Switch


Added a commandline switch (-DlangFromOS=true) to disable the language-selection dialog if a provided language in the installer matches the systemlanguage. --&gt; A User with a german system does not want to select the installationlanguage, if there is german as an option. Same applies to english users on english systems and so on. This is now added as an option, but I think this could also be the default behavior.
