<PRE>Vladimir,

yes, I do understand that. Still, the SimpleFinishPanel was specifically
implemented not to write an auto install script. I don't know about others
on the development team, but I am not in favor of changing that behavior.
Particularly not, if this fact is not obvious (automatic writing).

Also, as I had outlined before, I do not think this is a very potent weapon
to reveal install related problems. However there might be different views
on this issue. Therefore, if it appears to be of advantage what you propose,
then my recommendation would be to upgrade the FinishPanel, so that it can
be re-configured for automatic dumping of a script, rather than having a
button that lets the operator decide. In this case the developer is very
aware of what he is doing.

	Elmar

</I>Yes, but users normally wouldn't generate the auto-script and would have
nothing to send us.
