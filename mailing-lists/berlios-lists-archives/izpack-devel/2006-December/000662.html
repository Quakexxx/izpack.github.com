<PRE>Hi,

+1 :-) Since we provide the Javadoc as HTML, these API Overview (or better 
Developer Reference Manual) should be also up to date and usable.

&gt;<i> Hi Mrkus,
</I>&gt;<i> I do not agree with you that it is a good practice to ignore eclipse
</I>&gt;<i> warnings. Yes, most of it are related to missing or corrupt java doc.
</I>&gt;<i> May be we have not the time and/or not the knowledge to create sufficient
</I>&gt;<i> java doc comments for old code. But we can do it for our new code. Also for
</I>&gt;<i> getter and setter. It is possible to use template for simple situation. You
</I>&gt;<i> need a &lt;ctrl&gt; &lt;shift&gt; J grip... And you do not forget the java doc at
</I>&gt;<i> methods where it is really needed. It is contents of the language and it is
</I>&gt;<i> recommanded to comment all non-private methods. Not all developer uses the
</I>&gt;<i> source as docu. If we do it not, the code will be not better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> May be it is possible to use implicit developing rules if the developing
</I>&gt;<i> group consists of one or two people, but not with nearly twenty. One makes
</I>&gt;<i> no java comment, the other do not attend the dtd (or writes no) and some
</I>&gt;<i> others do not write docu for the features or do not update it at changes.
</I>&gt;<i> Not forget different coding styles...
</I>&gt;<i> To supress such chaos it is needed to say something about it from time to
</I>&gt;<i> time (it is also addressed to me).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I read some posts about this the last few days and like to share a few
</I>&gt;<i> thoughts about this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I switched from JBuilder to Eclipse last summer with my project,
</I>&gt;<i> Eclipse showed up with several thousands Problems. First I thought, &quot;oh
</I>&gt;<i> dear, there is so much wrong with my code? Lets fix all of this and I get
</I>&gt;<i> more reliable code (higher quality)...&quot;. When I got deeper into this, I
</I>&gt;<i> realized, that most of those problem warnings are irrelevant. It just makes
</I>&gt;<i> no sense to add a foll blown javadoc comment to a simple selfexplainatory
</I>&gt;<i> method. What happens most in such cases is, that the programmer then simply
</I>&gt;<i> adds a dummy comment (no real explaination, its there only to quiten
</I>&gt;<i> eclipse). And in fact I saw this in many projects. It just makes no sense
</I>&gt;<i> to rewrite in javadoc what is written in the method declaration already.
</I>&gt;<i> Often it's also much better and sufficient to write a good class comment.
</I>&gt;<i> Then iot makes no sense to rewrite the comment for the methods again. The
</I>&gt;<i> other point that often happens with such (dummy) comments is, that -
</I>&gt;<i> because they are irrelevant - they will not be maintained when developing
</I>&gt;<i> the code. What I like a lot more, are comments inside the code block (as it
</I>&gt;<i> is done in IzPack already very well I argue). But this can not be tested
</I>&gt;<i> with eclipse of corse...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So maybe you should concentrate on real problems, open points and fixing
</I>&gt;<i> bugs rather than quitening eclipse's problem tab.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Markus
