<PRE>Hi Elmar,
I am waiting for it :-)
You know, I think it will be nice if there are &quot;slots&quot;
additional to types of events to keep track of if there are
many logs of type message. You know the situation where a 
log file containts a MB informations.
But it is only a wish of me.
Rest context related.

Cheers 

Klaus

</I>&gt;<i>Hi everybody,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>sorry, I was spaced out for a bit, wanted to send this earlier 
</I>&gt;<i>but a lot was
</I>&gt;<i>going on in my world... anyway, here we continue with logging
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Please send comments, proposals etc. and let me know if you can help a
</I>&gt;<i>little with this project. There is still some work to be done on many
</I>&gt;<i>fronts, though none of it should be a major amount.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>What has happened and what is implemented so far?
</I>&gt;<i>=================================================
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>So far I have implemented a logger class and modified it 
</I>&gt;<i>according to some
</I>&gt;<i>feedback I received. This class can do the following:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>1) it can be used to log any event of interest during an installation
</I>&gt;<i>2) depending on the types of events recorded 
</I>&gt;<i>(message/warning/error) the
</I>&gt;<i>class provides flags for the GUI to present an appropriate 
</I>&gt;<i>generic message
</I>&gt;<i>3) an exception can be attached to warning and error messages
</I>&gt;<i>4) it can build a localized text report and provides the 
</I>&gt;<i>necessary UI to
</I>&gt;<i>save the report to a file of the users choice.
</I>

May be configurable. Other installer writes logging also without
asking the user. May be we can declare central a support directory
where also other loggings can be stored (e.g. the summary). 


&gt;<i>5) there is special handling support for use of (4) in an automated
</I>&gt;<i>installer. In this case a message dialog is popped up that 
</I>&gt;<i>also allows the
</I>&gt;<i>user to save the report if there are any warning or error 
</I>&gt;<i>messages recorded.
</I>

Have to be configurable because there are installations without
user interaction.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>What needs to be decided and what is yet to be implemented?
</I>&gt;<i>===========================================================
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>1) the two finish panels need to be upgraded to display a 
</I>&gt;<i>generic message
</I>&gt;<i>indicating installation success
</I>&gt;<i>2) the two finish panels need to be upgraded to provide a 
</I>&gt;<i>button for saving
</I>&gt;<i>the report
</I>

I have to see the impl or the docu to see whether I understand
the usage or not :-) If so, I can do 1) and 2).

&gt;<i>3) Log needs to integrated with the project (who can check the 
</I>&gt;<i>code in for
</I>&gt;<i>me?)
</I>&gt;<i>4) Julien has proposed to add a GUI element to the installer frame that
</I>&gt;<i>displays a message if a warning or error was recorded. This 
</I>&gt;<i>would have to be
</I>&gt;<i>implemented and wired with the logger for updating.
</I>&gt;<i>5) what should be done if the developer decides not to use a 
</I>&gt;<i>finish panel or
</I>&gt;<i>wants to write his own?
</I>
If some one will not say good by, he has bad luck. We should not
support discourteousness with a hack from us for it :-)

May be this is a good reason to bring together FinishPPanel and 
SimpleFinishPanel. At upgrading the two panels create a base class
which makes all common stuff. A developer which needs an own
finish panel should be used then this base. If not, he has also bad luck...


&gt;<i>6) some re-factoring work is required surrounding InstallData
</I>&gt;<i>7) there are LOTS of messages to be translated ~:o)
</I>
I assume that you make the English and the German. Therefore there is
no part for me :-)

&gt;<i>8) logging should be used -&gt; implement lots of logging all 
</I>&gt;<i>over the code!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
If system exist, I will do it in my stuff.
What about to publish the panel list where developer will be insert
his mnemonic.
