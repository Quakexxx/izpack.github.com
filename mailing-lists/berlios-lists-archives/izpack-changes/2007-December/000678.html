+Dynamic Variables
+-----------------
+
+Dynamic variables can be defined in the installation XML with the ``&lt;variable&gt;`` tag inside
+the ``&lt;dynamicvariables&gt;`` element. The value of dynamic variables will be evaluated every time a panel
+is switched, i.e. between the panels. Dynamic variables can have a condition which will be evaluated
+first. If it's true, the value would be assigned, otherwise nothing happens to the variable.
+
+Example: To change a certain directory based on user input, use the following
+``&lt;variable name=&quot;test&quot; value=&quot;/test/${USER_INPUT}&quot; condition=&quot;hasuserinput&quot; /&gt;`` 
+The condition has userinput has to be specified in the condition section of installation XML.

+The dynamic Variables Element ``&lt;dynamicvariables&gt;``
+''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
 
+This element allows you to define dynamic variables for the variables substitution
+system. In contrast to the static ``&lt;variables``, dynamic variables will be evaluated
+every time, a panel switch is done.
+
+When you define a set of variables, you just have to place as many ``&lt;variable&gt;`` tags 
+in the file as needed. Normally you would use the condition attribute to specify, when 
+a certain value will be set. 
+
+One ``&lt;variable&gt;`` tag take the following attributes :
+
+-   ``name`` : the variable name
+-   ``value`` : the variable value
+-   ``condition`` : a condition for this variable, which has to be true to set the value
+
+Here's a sample ``&lt;dynamicvariables&gt;`` section :
+
+
+::
+
+    &lt;dynamicvariables&gt;
+      &lt;variable name=&quot;app-version&quot; value=&quot;1.4&quot; condition=&quot;mycondition1&quot; /&gt;
+      &lt;variable name=&quot;app-version&quot; value=&quot;1.4b&quot; condition=&quot;!mycondition1&quot; /&gt;
+      &lt;variable name=&quot;released-on&quot; value=&quot;08/03/2002&quot; /&gt;
+    &lt;/dynamicvariables&gt;
+
+
+The Conditions Element ``&lt;conditions&gt;``
+''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+This element allows you to define conditions which can be used to dynamically change the installer, 
+e.g. the panels shown, the variables set, files parsed, files
+executed and much more. When you define a condition it will get a type and an id. The id has to be unique. Conditions can be referenced
+based on this id (e.g. with the ``RefCondition``). 
+
+There are several built-in types of conditions. At the time of writing this, Izpack has the following built-in types:
+
+-	``VariableCondition``: a condition based on the value of a certain variable
+-	``PackSelectionCondition``: a condition based on a pack selected for installation
+-	``JavaCondition``: a condition based on a static java field or method.
+
+There are also boolean types to combine more than one condition:
+
+- 	``AndCondition``: both conditions have to be true
+-	``OrCondition``: only one of both conditions has to be true
+- 	``XOrCondition``: one condition has to be true, the other one has to be false
+- 	``NotCondition``: the condition has to be false
+
+When you define a set of conditions, you just have to write as many ``&lt;condition&gt;`` tags as you like. A
+condition can take the following attributes:
+
+- 	``type``: the type of the condition. For built-in types, this is the lowercase portion of the condition class
+              name without condition appended (variable,packselection,java, ...)
+- 	``id``: the id of the condition. This will be used to refer to this conditions in other elements
+
+The condition element can have several child elements depending on the type of this conditions. E.g. the VariableCondition
+has a name and value child element to specify, which variable should have a certain value to fullfil this condition.
+
+:: 	This is an example which defines four conditions, two VariableConditions, a JavaCondition and a AndCondition which will
+    refer to two of the first conditions.
+    
+   &lt;conditions&gt;
+      &lt;condition type=&quot;variable&quot; id=&quot;standardinstallation&quot;&gt;
+         &lt;name&gt;setup.type&lt;/name&gt;
+         &lt;value&gt;standard&lt;/name&gt;
+      &lt;/condition&gt;
+      &lt;condition type=&quot;variable&quot; id=&quot;expertinstallation&quot;&gt;
+         &lt;name&gt;setup.type&lt;/name&gt;
+         &lt;value&gt;expert&lt;/name&gt;
+      &lt;/condition&gt;
+      &lt;condition type=&quot;java&quot; id=&quot;installonwindows&quot;&gt;
+		&lt;java&gt;
+			&lt;class&gt;com.izforge.izpack.util.OsVersion&lt;/class&gt;
+			&lt;field&gt;IS_WINDOWS&lt;/field&gt;
+		&lt;/java&gt;
+		&lt;returnvalue type=&quot;boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/returnvalue&gt;
+	  &lt;/condition&gt;
+	  &lt;condition type=&quot;and&quot; id=&quot;standardinstallation.onwindows&quot;&gt;
+	  	&lt;condition type=&quot;ref&quot; refid=&quot;standardinstallation&quot;/&gt;
+	  	&lt;condition type=&quot;ref&quot; refid=&quot;installonwindows&quot; /&gt;
+	  &lt;/condition&gt;
+   &lt;/condition&gt;
+   
+Note, from IzPack 3.11 on normally, you don't have to define the compound conditions because you can use a simple
+expression language. The language has the following operators:
+
+-	``+``: an operator for the Andcondition
+- 	``|``: an operator for the OrCondition
+- 	``\``: an operator for the XOrCondition
+-	``!``: an operator for the NotCondition
+
+Neverthless if you define really complex conditions it's much easier to define them using the xml structure.
