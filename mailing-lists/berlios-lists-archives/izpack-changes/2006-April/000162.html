-
-&lt;p&gt;Version 2, June 1991&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;pre&gt;
-Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  
-59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA
-
-Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
-of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-&lt;/pre&gt;
-
-&lt;h2&gt;Preamble&lt;/h2&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
-free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors
-commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and
-charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can
-do these things.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
-you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can
-get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and
-passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making
-the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;h2&gt;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&lt;/h2&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0.&lt;/strong&gt; This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public
-License. The &quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot; means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
-containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
-&quot;modification&quot;.) Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
-Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each
-copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
-Program a copy of this License along with the Program.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the
-terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;dl&gt;
-&lt;dd&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a)&lt;/strong&gt; You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&lt;/dd&gt;
-&lt;/dl&gt;
-
-&lt;dl&gt;
-&lt;dd&gt;&lt;strong&gt;b)&lt;/strong&gt; You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no
-charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&lt;/dd&gt;
-&lt;/dl&gt;
-
-&lt;dl&gt;
-&lt;dd&gt;&lt;strong&gt;c)&lt;/strong&gt; If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or
-display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program
-under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
-the Program is not required to print an announcement.)&lt;/dd&gt;
-&lt;/dl&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work
-based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless
-of who wrote it.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
-derivative or collective works based on the Program.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
-other work under the scope of this License.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you
-also do one of the following: &lt;!-- we use this doubled UL to get the sub-sections indented, --&gt; &lt;!-- while making the bullets as unobvious as possible. --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;dl&gt;
-&lt;dd&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a)&lt;/strong&gt; Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
-software interchange; or,&lt;/dd&gt;
-&lt;/dl&gt;
-
-&lt;dl&gt;
-&lt;dd&gt;&lt;strong&gt;b)&lt;/strong&gt; Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a
-complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,&lt;/dd&gt;
-&lt;/dl&gt;
-
-&lt;dl&gt;
-&lt;dd&gt;&lt;strong&gt;c)&lt;/strong&gt; Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and
-only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)&lt;/dd&gt;
-&lt;/dl&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
-plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not
-include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless
-that component itself accompanies the executable.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
-distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.&lt;/strong&gt; You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute
-the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
-terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.&lt;/strong&gt; You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative
-works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of
-this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6.&lt;/strong&gt; Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or
-modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
-compliance by third parties to this License.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.&lt;/strong&gt; If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by
-court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
-simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not
-permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
-entirely from distribution of the Program.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
-in other circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of
-protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
-distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system
-and a licensee cannot impose that choice.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.&lt;/strong&gt; If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the
-Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such
-case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9.&lt;/strong&gt; The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
-version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the
-terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any
-version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.&lt;/strong&gt; If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software
-which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
-status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NO WARRANTY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11.&lt;/strong&gt; BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
-COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
-AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
-REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12.&lt;/strong&gt; IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED
-ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
-DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED
-OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;h2&gt;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&lt;/h2&gt;
-
-&lt;h2&gt;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&lt;/h2&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change
-under these terms.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have
-at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;pre&gt;
-&lt;var&gt;one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.&lt;/var&gt;
-Copyright (C) &lt;var&gt;yyyy&lt;/var&gt;  &lt;var&gt;name of author&lt;/var&gt;
-
-This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
-modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
-as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
-of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
-
-This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
-but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
-MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
-GNU General Public License for more details.
-
-You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
-along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
-Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA.
-&lt;/pre&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;pre&gt;
-Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) &lt;var&gt;year&lt;/var&gt; &lt;var&gt;name of author&lt;/var&gt;
-Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
-type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
-to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' 
-for details.
-
-&lt;/pre&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;The hypothetical commands &lt;samp&gt;`show w'&lt;/samp&gt; and &lt;samp&gt;`show c'&lt;/samp&gt; should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something
-other than &lt;samp&gt;`show w'&lt;/samp&gt; and &lt;samp&gt;`show c'&lt;/samp&gt;; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;pre&gt;
-Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
-interest in the program `Gnomovision'
-(which makes passes at compilers) written 
-by James Hacker.
-
-&lt;var&gt;signature of Ty Coon&lt;/var&gt;, 1 April 1989
-Ty Coon, President of Vice
-&lt;/pre&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking
-proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the &lt;a href=&quot;/licenses/lgpl.html&quot;&gt;GNU Lesser General Public License&lt;/a&gt; instead of this License.&lt;/p&gt;
-&lt;/body&gt;

- &lt;p&gt;The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
-  license, subject to third party intellectual property claims:

-   above, no patent license is granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from
-   the Contributor Version; 2) separate from the Contributor Version; 3) for infringements
-   caused by: i) third party modifications of Contributor Version or ii) the combination of
-   Modifications made by that Contributor with other software (except as part of the

-   in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.

- &lt;h2 id=&quot;section-3&quot;&gt;3. Distribution Obligations.&lt;/h2&gt;
- &lt;h3 id=&quot;section-3.1&quot;&gt;3.1. Application of License.&lt;/h3&gt;
- &lt;p&gt;The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms
-  of this License, including without limitation Section &lt;a href=&quot;#section-2.2&quot;&gt;2.2&lt;/a&gt;. The
-  Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License
-  or a future version of this License released under Section &lt;a href=&quot;#section-6.1&quot;&gt;6.1&lt;/a&gt;,
-  and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
-  distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or
-  restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.
-  However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in
-  Section &lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.5&quot;&gt;3.5&lt;/a&gt;.
- &lt;h3 id=&quot;section-3.2&quot;&gt;3.2. Availability of Source Code.&lt;/h3&gt;
- &lt;p&gt;Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in
-  Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable
-  version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
-  Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,
-  must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became
-  available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular
-  Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring
-  that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution
-  Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
- &lt;h3 id=&quot;section-3.3&quot;&gt;3.3. Description of Modifications.&lt;/h3&gt;
- &lt;p&gt;You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the
-  changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a
-  prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
-  Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in
-  (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation
-  in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
- &lt;h3 id=&quot;section-3.4&quot;&gt;3.4. Intellectual Property Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
- &lt;h4 id=&quot;section-3.4-a&quot;&gt;(a) Third Party Claims&lt;/h4&gt;
- &lt;p&gt;If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property
-  rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections
-  &lt;a href=&quot;#section-2.1&quot;&gt;2.1&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;#section-2.2&quot;&gt;2.2&lt;/a&gt;, Contributor must include a
-  text file with the Source Code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; which describes the claim and the
-  party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If
-  Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in
-  Section &lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.2&quot;&gt;3.2&lt;/a&gt;, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in
-  all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as
-  notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who
-  received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
- &lt;h4 id=&quot;section-3.4-b&quot;&gt;(b) Contributor APIs&lt;/h4&gt;
- &lt;p&gt;If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor
-  has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that
-  &lt;abbr&gt;API&lt;/abbr&gt;, Contributor must also include this information in the
-  &lt;strong class=&quot;very-strong&quot;&gt;legal&lt;/strong&gt; file.
- &lt;h4 id=&quot;section-3.4-c&quot;&gt;(c) Representations.&lt;/h4&gt;
- &lt;p&gt;Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4
-  (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.4-a&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications
-  are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the
-  rights conveyed by this License.
- &lt;h3 id=&quot;section-3.5&quot;&gt;3.5. Required Notices.&lt;/h3&gt;
- &lt;p&gt;You must duplicate the notice in &lt;a href=&quot;#exhibit-a&quot;&gt;Exhibit A&lt;/a&gt; in each file of the
-  Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to
-  its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory)
-  where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more
-  Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
-  &lt;a href=&quot;#exhibit-a&quot;&gt;Exhibit A&lt;/a&gt;. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
-  for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to
-  Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity
-  or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so
-  only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You
-  must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability
-  obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
-  and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor
-  as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
- &lt;h3 id=&quot;section-3.6&quot;&gt;3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.&lt;/h3&gt;
- &lt;p&gt;You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Sections
-  &lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.1&quot;&gt;3.1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.2&quot;&gt;3.2&lt;/a&gt;,
-  &lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.3&quot;&gt;3.3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.4&quot;&gt;3.4&lt;/a&gt; and
-  &lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.5&quot;&gt;3.5&lt;/a&gt; have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a
-  notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms
-  of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations
-  of Section &lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.2&quot;&gt;3.2&lt;/a&gt;. The notice must be conspicuously included in any
-  notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe
-  recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of
-  Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
-  different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this
-  License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the
-  recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If
-  You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely
-  clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the
-  Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
-  every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as
-  a result of any such terms You offer.
- &lt;h3 id=&quot;section-3.7&quot;&gt;3.7. Larger Works.&lt;/h3&gt;
- &lt;p&gt;You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the
-  terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case,
-  You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
- &lt;h2 id=&quot;section-4&quot;&gt;4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.&lt;/h2&gt;
- &lt;p&gt;If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to
-  some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must:
-  (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe
-  the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the
-  &lt;strong class=&quot;very-strong&quot;&gt;legal&lt;/strong&gt; file described in Section
-  &lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.4&quot;&gt;3.4&lt;/a&gt; and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
-  Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
-  sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
- &lt;h2 id=&quot;section-5&quot;&gt;5. Application of this License.&lt;/h2&gt;
- &lt;p&gt;This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in
-  &lt;a href=&quot;#exhibit-a&quot;&gt;Exhibit A&lt;/a&gt; and to related Covered Code.
- &lt;h2 id=&quot;section-6&quot;&gt;6. Versions of the License.&lt;/h2&gt;
- &lt;h3 id=&quot;section-6.1&quot;&gt;6.1. New Versions&lt;/h3&gt;
- &lt;p&gt;Netscape Communications Corporation (&quot;Netscape&quot;) may publish revised and/or new versions
-  of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
- &lt;h3 id=&quot;section-6.2&quot;&gt;6.2. Effect of New Versions&lt;/h3&gt;
- &lt;p&gt;Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may
-  always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such
-  Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape.
-  No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code
-  created under this License.
- &lt;h3 id=&quot;section-6.3&quot;&gt;6.3. Derivative Works&lt;/h3&gt;
- &lt;p&gt;If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to
- apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a)
- rename Your license so that the phrases &quot;Mozilla&quot;, &quot;MOZILLAPL&quot;, &quot;MOZPL&quot;, &quot;Netscape&quot;, &quot;MPL&quot;,
- &quot;NPL&quot; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that
- your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of
- the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public
- License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the
- notice described in &lt;a href=&quot;#exhibit-a&quot;&gt;Exhibit A&lt;/a&gt; shall not of themselves be deemed to
- be modifications of this License.)
- &lt;h2 id=&quot;section-7&quot;&gt;7. &lt;strong class=&quot;very-strong&quot;&gt;Disclaimer of warranty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
- &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;very-strong&quot;&gt;Covered code is provided under this license on an &quot;as is&quot;
-  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, without
-  limitation, warranties that the covered code is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a
-  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of
-  the covered code is with you. Should any covered code prove defective in any respect, you
-  (not the initial developer or any other contributor) assume the cost of any necessary
-  servicing, repair or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part
-  of this license. No use of any covered code is authorized hereunder except under this
-  disclaimer.&lt;/strong&gt;
- &lt;h2 id=&quot;section-8&quot;&gt;8. Termination&lt;/h2&gt;
- &lt;p id=&quot;section-8.1&quot;&gt;8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
-  automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach
-  within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which
-  are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by
-  their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.
- &lt;p id=&quot;section-8.2&quot;&gt;8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
-  claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor
-  (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to
-  as &quot;Participant&quot;) alleging that:
- &lt;ol type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;
-  &lt;li id=&quot;section-8.2-a&quot;&gt;such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
-   infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under
-   Sections &lt;a href=&quot;#section-2.1&quot;&gt;2.1&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=&quot;#section-2.2&quot;&gt;2.2&lt;/a&gt; of this
-   License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if
-   within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay
-   Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of
-   Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with
-   respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of
-   notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in
-   writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by
-   Participant to You under Sections &lt;a href=&quot;#section-2.1&quot;&gt;2.1&lt;/a&gt; and/or
-   &lt;a href=&quot;#section-2.2&quot;&gt;2.2&lt;/a&gt; automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day
-   notice period specified above.
-  &lt;li id=&quot;section-8.2-b&quot;&gt;any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
-   Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights
-   granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(&lt;a href=&quot;#section-2.1-b&quot;&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;)
-   and 2.2(&lt;a href=&quot;#section-2.2-b&quot;&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;) are revoked effective as of the date You first
-   made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.
- &lt;/ol&gt;
- &lt;p id=&quot;section-8.3&quot;&gt;8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
-  alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
-  any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the
-  initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
-  granted by such Participant under Sections &lt;a href=&quot;#section-2.1&quot;&gt;2.1&lt;/a&gt; or
-  &lt;a href=&quot;#section-2.2&quot;&gt;2.2&lt;/a&gt; shall be taken into account in determining the amount or
-  value of any payment or license.
- &lt;p id=&quot;section-8.4&quot;&gt;8.4. In the event of termination under Sections
-  &lt;a href=&quot;#section-8.1&quot;&gt;8.1&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;#section-8.2&quot;&gt;8.2&lt;/a&gt; above, all end user
-  license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly
-  granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive
-  termination.
- &lt;h2 id=&quot;section-9&quot;&gt;9. &lt;strong class=&quot;very-strong&quot;&gt;Limitation of liability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
- &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;very-strong&quot;&gt;Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether
-  tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall you, the initial developer,
-  any other contributor, or any distributor of covered code, or any supplier of any of
-  such parties, be liable to any person for any indirect, special, incidental, or
-  consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for loss
-  of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
-  commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the
-  possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability
-  for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent
-  applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion
-  or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation
-  may not apply to you.&lt;/strong&gt;
- &lt;h2 id=&quot;section-10&quot;&gt;10. &lt;abbr title=&quot;United States&quot;&gt;U.S.&lt;/abbr&gt; government end users&lt;/h2&gt;
- &lt;p&gt;The Covered Code is a &quot;commercial item,&quot; as that term is defined in 48
-  &lt;abbr&gt;C.F.R.&lt;/abbr&gt; 2.101 (&lt;abbr title=&quot;October&quot;&gt;Oct.&lt;/abbr&gt; 1995), consisting of
-  &quot;commercial computer software&quot; and &quot;commercial computer software documentation,&quot; as such
-  terms are used in 48 &lt;abbr&gt;C.F.R.&lt;/abbr&gt; 12.212 (&lt;abbr title=&quot;September&quot;&gt;Sept.&lt;/abbr&gt;
-  1995). Consistent with 48 &lt;abbr&gt;C.F.R.&lt;/abbr&gt; 12.212 and 48 &lt;abbr&gt;C.F.R.&lt;/abbr&gt;
-  227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all &lt;abbr&gt;U.S.&lt;/abbr&gt; Government End Users
-  acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.
- &lt;h2 id=&quot;section-11&quot;&gt;11. Miscellaneous&lt;/h2&gt;
- &lt;p&gt;This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If
-  any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
-  reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be
-  governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
-  provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to
-  disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or
-  registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to
-  this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the
-  Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California,
-  with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court
-  costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United
-  Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
-  excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
-  shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
- &lt;h2 id=&quot;section-12&quot;&gt;12. Responsibility for claims&lt;/h2&gt;
- &lt;p&gt;As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for
-  claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights
-  under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to
-  distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
-  shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
- &lt;h2 id=&quot;section-13&quot;&gt;13. Multiple-licensed code&lt;/h2&gt;
- &lt;p&gt;Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
-  &quot;Multiple-Licensed&quot;. &quot;Multiple-Licensed&quot; means that the Initial Developer permits
-  you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the &lt;abbr&gt;MPL&lt;/abbr&gt;
-  or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file
-  described in &lt;a href=&quot;#exhibit-a&quot;&gt;Exhibit A&lt;/a&gt;.
