<PRE>Hi Hans-Georg,
I know that there was (is) a bug related to &lt;executable&gt; tag.
At the time you have written the problems I have made
a test project and tested and debugged it. Additional I have
made an investigation in the svn to see at what time the
change of the default was.
The bug is in the docu because the behavior of IzPack 
(default &quot;never&quot;) has never changed. 
I agree with you that this have to be fixed.
I have done it at 2006.10.20.

After it some mails have been needed to close impasses and
came to the ground. Your conclusions were possible but
with that powerful opinion sometimes a little bit fast.
May be the time would be better investigated for new
problems.

I have learned, that I have to be more stringent in
demand on sufficient informations. It costs only time to
guess the reason of a problem.
On the JAI mailing list (Java Advanced Imaging from sunsoft)
often a problem will only performed if the user sends a runable
demo. That should I claim also.

Your mails have me triggert to look around (before I have
settled to IzPack I have tested more than one other installer,
but this are some years ago) to other installer. 
It seems so that you have tested install4j.
In opposite to IzPack install4j has a nice GUI. But I see
only the way via custom code to make the same as IzPacks
&lt;execute&gt; tag. 
Again, how can I execute programms OS dependant in install4j?


Cheers

Klaus
