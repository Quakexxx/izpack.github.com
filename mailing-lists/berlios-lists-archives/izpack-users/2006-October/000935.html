Found a workaround, or maybe I hadn't understood how it works. I
now write excludes=&quot;configuration configuration/**/*&quot;, i.e. I
exclude the folder and then explicitly all its possible content.

Strikes me as nonsense, because, if I exclude a folder, then
it's pretty obvious that its content must be excluded as well.
But anyway, the workaround works.

If that's how it should be, then at least a remark belongs into
the documentation that excluding a folder doesn't automatically
exclude its content, because that's certainly not obvious to a
normal user.

I think it would be better if IzPack were intelligent enough to
know that excluding a folder also means to exclude its contents,
so maybe this could be taken as a wish for improvement.
