Klaus,

thanks for your reply! My mistake was to see it simply from a
user's point of view, a user who doesn't know Ant and just wants
to make an installer.

I have a very simple proposal. If somebody could just add a few
more examples to the documentation, including one example of how
to exclude an entire folder, that would be a very easy way to
solve this problem. It could save most casual users the effort
to learn the Ant syntax.

By the way, the Ant documentation doesn't make this case any
clearer. My first attempt at reading it seemed to indicate that
this case, excluding just a folder by writing its name, isn't
documented anywhere, and simply doesn't work straightforwardly
in Ant either.

A question to the Ant gurus: Is there one single ant pattern
that matches a folder and at the same time all its contens? And
works in an exclude expression?

Hans-Georg
