<PRE>In version 3.9.0 I have the following two lines in a pack
definition:

  &lt;parsable os=&quot;windows&quot;
targetfile=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH/lib/install_helper.bat&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;executable os=&quot;windows&quot;
targetfile=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH/lib/install_helper.bat&quot;/&gt;

The file install_helper.bat is actually copied, parsed, and a
path is correctly inserted, but executed it is not.

This file is also kept, although I haven't entered the keep
attribute. It seems as if the &lt;executable ...&gt; tag is not there
at all.

I have a very similar other file with stage=&quot;uninstall&quot;, and
that works perfectly during the uninstall process. But the above
file should be run at the end of the install process, and that
doesn't work here.

The doc says that stage=&quot;postinstall&quot; is the default, and I've
tried both including and dropping that attribute, to no avail.

What's up? Any ideas? What could I have overlooked?

Hans-Georg
