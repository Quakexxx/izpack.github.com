Klaus,

thanks for looking into this!

I fear I'm not in a position to write a bug report to sunsoft,
because I can't retrace or demo the bug for them. I would do it,
if only I could. I'm not a Java developer and don't even have a
Java compiler or debugger ready. (This may change soon, but not
yet.)

In fact I don't like to write bug reports. I strongly prefer
bug-free software. But I do write them, if I have to. If I find
a bug that will affect many other users, I will write a bug
report, even if I already know a workaround. A little bit of
altruism here, in return for the altruism of the developers, who
do all the major work. I hope, of course, that the developers
appreciate bug reports.

By the way, currently I'm stumped by the other apparent bug,
concerning &lt;executable ...&gt; (see other thread). If I cannot
resolve that, my choices are very limited. Going back to 3.8.1
is nearly out of the question, so I'd have to go to another
product altogether, probably install4j. I hope I'm only making a
mistake here and someone can point it out, or perhaps it's
another one of those documentation mismatches. Do you have any
idea about that one? Should go in the other thread, but since
you're reading this one, I thought I might as well ask.

Hans-Georg
