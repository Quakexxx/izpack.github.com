I wrote the DataCheckPanel class and uploaded it to the list.  I don't 
know if it was ever actually added to the source code.  I'm basically 
self taught, so I've missed a lot of things along the way in software, 
including some basics.  I've never quite gotten used to CVS or 
Subversion (and I think I'd have to be classified as a developer here 
to be able to add to the source in Subversion, but am not sure).

I don't know if DataCheckPanel was ever added to the source or not, but 
the original post with it included as an attachment should still be in 
the archives if you search for it.  It may make it easier to search for 
posts by me (Hal Vaughan), since I forgot what the subject of the post 
would be.
