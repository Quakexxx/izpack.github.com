<PRE>Hi yossi,

no worries for the number of questions !
so to be clearer, i personnaly created some text files including the PL-SQL
code in it.
I don't see why you couldn't use any other kind of files. If you want to use
an xml, just change a bit my code to parse the tree and retrieve the query
to send to the
RunSQLMS or RunSQLOracle method.Regarding the structure of the folders, i
guess my cookbook isn't clear enough.What you need is to create a folder and
put the class, the launchsql.bat or sh, the JDBC drivers and two
subfolders:a.. sqlsms, for SQL Server scriptsb.. sqlsoracle, for oracle
scriptsThis is all due to the fact that when i create this help, IzPack
didn't support packs/processes dependance.You could just change a bit the
code to make it nicer if you want. Otherwise this works just fine.FWI, i use
it for my company on a daily basis and always successful.I like to have it
this way so that each pack could correspond to a new version or a patch....I
use it for an updater. You select which update you want to install and it
doesn't the job (copying new files, updating old ones and run the needed
SQLs)Hope that helps.FabricePS: Don't hesitate to ask me for more detailed
help on the code.----- Original Message -----

Subject: [izpack-users] Updating db with INSTALL_PATH value


Hi Miraodb,
I'm using the latest 3.8.1 for the matter.
I saw your code and I'm gonna use it (need to change to mysql db), my
question is, after compiling the code to a class, where should I put it
and where should the query be? can I put the query in
myAntActionsSpec.xml or Mysql.xml or install.xml? and how do I use it?
I can't use the main() of cours so I need to send all variables some how
to your class.
Many question.....sorry for that.
Thanks again for your time
cheers
Yossi
