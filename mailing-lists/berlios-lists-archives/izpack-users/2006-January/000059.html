<PRE>  Hi Friends,

  Klaus am almost through and could see the end of the installation, but not getting the product installed.
 
Am trying to execute a shell script at the postinstall stage it has the executable permission as expected with the help of ChmodCompilerListener and ChmodInstallerListener,  there I was only provided with a &quot;?&quot; screen asking for continuation, when I press &quot;Continue&quot; the installer reports that installation was successful, but my script has not been excuted to do the application related activities,,
 
What is wrong here friends,, I was not able to understand what is going on when the script was executed or else anyother formality to be carried at this moment?.
 
Even I commented out all my &quot;echo&quot; statements in my script files just tried to avoid writing to the gui installer unless it will display some messages to the console at the time of installation.
 
  Can you show me an example code of install.xml with lines calling executable script included to run it at the postinstall stage.
  
help me friends,,
 
regards,
 
Se.
