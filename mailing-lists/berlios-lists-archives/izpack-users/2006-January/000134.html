<PRE>Hal,
   Thanks for the quick response! I will check this out. Here is my 
exact scenario though.

I have some jars and .zip files that I want to bundle together into a 
single installer and allow
the user to choose which packs they want to install. However, for each 
pack, they need to be
prompted for a directory to perform the installation since they go in 
different places. I was initially
wondering if the install panel could simply appear more than once, but 
my test suggests it can't.

Perhaps in the future, &lt;pack&gt; elements can also contain panels of their 
own to tailor installations
per pack. Maybe this would not be too hard since the functionality is 
essentially there and the variables
could still be used as-is.

Just some thoughts.
Darren
