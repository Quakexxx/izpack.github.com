<PRE>Remember I mentioned writing a class to read attributes given to panels in 
install.xml?

It's done.  It requires there to be a file /res/install.xml, which means it 
has to be declared as a resource in the original install.xml file (whatever 
it is named).  It could easily be changed to read from any XML file anywhere 
in the install jar.

I also edited PasswordPanel to get the panel attributes from this class 
instead of reading install.xml directly.

It's time for sleep, but I thought I'd mention I had this working.  I can send 
you the class once I've had time to clean up the code (way to many debugging 
comments and printouts in there now!).

I think I read somewhere that there was an intent to not let install.xml get 
too cluttered.  Unless I missed a method somewhere (and I looked carefully), 
the class I wrote (PanelAttributes) is the only allowance for reading the 
panel attributes.  If more panels are going to use this method of having 
attributes in the install.xml file, it seems to me it might be a good idea if 
either the install.xml file is automatically included OR just the &lt;panels&gt; 
section could be extracted and put in /res.

Just some late night musings.  Let me know what you think and what I've missed 
on this.

Keep well,

Hal
