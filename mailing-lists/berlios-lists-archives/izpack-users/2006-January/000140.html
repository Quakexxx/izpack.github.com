<PRE>Hi Miraodb,
   
  Thanks for your guidance,
   
  I hope you may have seen these line before
   
  &gt; &gt; I just studied and understood the silent installer &quot;auto-install.xml&quot;,
&gt;<i> &gt; but it is not helpful to sort out this problem,,
</I>
This is what you are suggesting me to go with (i completed and this and am expecting beyond that) but the thing is if am having the installer then I should not think for one more script file ( or the sort ) to control our installer by any ways. Installer should be one and one only as how we are doing with GUI based installations. Silent-installer will not work out always,, I cant predict the client environment. See I may have generated the install.jar on Solaris 9 terminal and want to install the product on the server that runs with or without any desktop.
   
  I appretiate silent-installer of IzPack but want to have the console based installer option from the same GUI based installer that we generate.
   
  If it is not possible by this time we may inform Julien for our to do list. Or any of you Friends may consider this feature for our future release of IzPack :-)
   
  regards,
   
  Se.

  hi,

Here's my thoughts:

In the FinishPanel, there's a button for generating an automated file which
can be used by izpack to run in command line without any user interaction.
We can trick that to do your job.

First you need to run your installer somewhere which can have the gui. (with
all aspects! ) Do it as if you were gonna install it on your Solaris 9.
(leave the userinputs empty)
Once you click on the button to generate the xml file. you can edit it and
replace the empty strings with a specific variable name of your choice.
let's say you have:







Then with a simple SH script you can look for the &quot;xxxxxxxxx&quot; string and
replace it with the user input that your script would have asked for
previously.

Then all you have to do is launch your installer with the xml file as a
parameter: java -jar yourinstaller.jar yourfile.xml

hope this helps.
fabrice
