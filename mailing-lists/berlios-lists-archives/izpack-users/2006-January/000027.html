<PRE>Hi all,
I have recieved no replies to my original question (included below), so 
I am re-posting it.  If no one can help me with this, either by 
providing an answer or by telling me how to debug the problem in the 
IzPack code, then I will regretfully have to abandon IzPack and build my 
own installer.

Java is able to directly copy all of the files (verified by test code in 
my application running on the target machine after the install), so the 
installation disk contents seem to be ok and the underlying Java file 
operations work correctly.  That would seem to indicate that the problem 
is in the IzPack code that copies the files.

Please offer any suggestions that come to mind.  Thanks.

Glenn
