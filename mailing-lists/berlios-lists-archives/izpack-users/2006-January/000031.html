<PRE>Hi hal,

&gt;<i> Is there some place I can get a list of the new features and bug fixes for
</I>the
&gt;<i> next version?  I want to know if what I need is being done, or if it is
</I>&gt;<i> something I should do myself.
</I>
This info is indeed avalaible.
If you have access to cvs, then do a checkout of the branch 3.8.
Instructions are at the following address:
<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/cvs/?group_id=1408">http://developer.berlios.de/cvs/?group_id=1408</A>

If you can't do a checkout, you can use the web interface for cvs on berlios
at the following address:
<A HREF="http://cvs.berlios.de/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/izpack/izpack-src/Versions.txt?only_with_tag=branch-3-8">http://cvs.berlios.de/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/izpack/izpack-src/Versions.txt?only_with_tag=branch-3-8</A>
and then look at the latest version of Version.txt for the branch 3.8.

All new modification until next release will be in this branch.
Before release everything will be merged to HEAD.


&gt;<i> I tried the Search example in the manual for the UserInput Panel and it
</I>does
&gt;<i> not work.  (Yes, I mean the exact example in the manual, exactly as it
</I>is.)
&gt;<i> I've mentioned in a few previous e-mails there seems to be a problem with
</I>&gt;<i> Search (and have yet to hear any comments like, &quot;Yes there is,&quot; or, &quot;It
</I>works
&gt;<i> perfectly, you're using it wrong&quot;).  If it worked, I *think* it would
</I>provide
&gt;<i> what I need to do.  Otherwise, I'll need to learn the API (and I'm not a
</I>&gt;<i> professional programmer, so I expect it to take a while) and write my own
</I>&gt;<i> panel (unless there's someone here who wants to write a panel if I pay a
</I>&gt;<i> bounty for it).  I would like to know, though, if what I'm doing is
</I>&gt;<i> duplicating work already being done.
</I>
Sorry if you got no answer...
The Search field is indeed having some troubles, i had for myself been
stocked trying to have more than one option listed in the dropdown listbox.

I believe someone is working on it. If not then we'll have to :-)

Cheers,
Hope this helps.
