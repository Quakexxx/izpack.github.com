This is where I'm still confused.  I remember Klaus mentioning this in 
response to an earlier question (which I cannot find!) about the difference 
between specifying an OS Family and OS Name.  In some places I think he said 
one was used earlier, but in the section you point to and at least one other 
section, both can be specified.

Is the intent now to keep the focus on the OS Family names (windows, unix, 
mac), or to allow OS Names (windows 2000, linux, freebsd)?

The reason I'm being so stubborn about this is that some things are different 
even in the same family.  For instance, in Windows NT and 2000, the path to 
Windows is usually C:\WINNT and in Windows XP (which, I've found is often 
seen as Windows 2000 in early JVMs) the path is C:\WINDOWS.
