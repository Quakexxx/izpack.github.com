I'm working on a series of panels that can be used more than once to find 
locations for different programs.  While the primary intent is different, it 
may help you.  In my case, I need 2 other programs for mine to work, so I 
have to ask the user if they have those programs and, if so, in what 
directory.  If they don't know, it locates them.  If they aren't installed, 
it asks them where to put it.

It should be late this week or early next before they're done.  They are not 
in CVS, I'm working on them with feedback from one of the developers.  If 
this will help you at all, let me know.  It does not effect the info about 
packs, though.  It will let you define the variable name to store the 
selected path, though.

This may be a bit complex, since it sounds like what you need is a slightly 
modified TargetPanel and a way to store the result in something for the 
packs' final location, but if this will help, you're welcome to it -- just 
let me finish it and clean up the messy code first!
