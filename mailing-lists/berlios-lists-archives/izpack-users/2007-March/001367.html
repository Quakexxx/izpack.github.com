Mandeep,

I have been moving all our projects to use maven2, and have created a custom 
archetype that I'm testing for creation of installers. It's all a bit of a 
hack, IMO, but it seems to work.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Along with this, I am writing few custom panels for my installer. Is
</I>&gt;<i> there any way to make jar file of those panels and move it to bin/panels
</I>&gt;<i> directory by using the maven izpack plugin. If not what is the right way
</I>&gt;<i> to incorporate the custom panels using maven2.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In order to write custom panels I am importing few panel classes like
</I>&gt;<i> com.izforge.izpack.panels.UserInputPanel in my panel classes. I have
</I>&gt;<i> defined the dependency on standalone-compiler.jar file but because this
</I>&gt;<i> jar file does not contain the panel classes so not able to compile the
</I>&gt;<i> code. Please suggest me how can I define dependency on these panel jar
</I>&gt;<i> files. Should I deploy jar file of each panel on my remote repository.
</I>&gt;<i> Or there is another way to deal with it.
</I>

My setup is to create a multiproject hierarchy with one panel per subproject. 
I've found it sufficient (but maybe not necessary) to add 4 artifacts from 
IzPack to my internal repository:

* InstallPanel 
* UserInputPanel 
* izevent 
* standalone-compiler

Each of my custom panels depends on some of these artifacts and is then 
deployed to the company repository. Once they're in there, I can use them in 
any installer as necessary.

The hacky bit really kicks in when I create the installer. I have a structure 
as follows

src
 /-main
  /-izpack
    /-lang
    /-en
    /-...

where the main izpack configuration files live in src/main/izpack whch is 
treated as a resource directory and filtered so I can have parameters like 
${pom.version} and the resources plugin looks in target/izpack for the output 
of the filtering process.

Some properties from my settings define where Izpack lives

  &lt;properties&gt;
    &lt;izpack.native&gt;/usr/local/IzPack-3.9.0-patched//bin/native&lt;/izpack.native&gt;
    &lt;izpack.basedir&gt;/usr/local/IzPack-3.9.0-patched/&lt;/izpack.basedir&gt;
    &lt;izpack.panels&gt;/usr/local/IzPack-3.9.0-patched//bin/panels&lt;/izpack.panels&gt;

and I use the dependency plugin for the panels I need (defined in the 
dependencies section) to copy the artifacts created by the subprojects from 
my repository into bin/panels.

Really, this should all be put into a custom plugin with a couple of mojos for 
panels, native code, etc. The archetype I created is a POM skeleton  for the 
plugin invocations. It  has the basic outline for jogging the memory of me or 
coworkers as to what needs to be done in creating a new installer (which 
should be rare enough that our memories will need jogging). It certainly 
wouldn't create a valid installer out of the box :(

What I have cobbled together seems to work so far for our needs. I just need 
to get time to refine it. If you want I can send you copy of what I've done.

The more I use  maven, the more I like it as a project development model, and 
it'd be nice if there was momentum to make IzPack a maven project. I fear 
that it's a lot of work, however.

Eric
