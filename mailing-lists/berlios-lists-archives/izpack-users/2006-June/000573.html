<PRE>Hi all
 
Can someone assist me on this please... have i got to build the entire
izpack project whenever I create a custom Panel or update the langpacks
(so that the standard-compiler jar gets updated with these) before I can
then build my own installation project??
 
Thanks
Jose

Subject: Getting Custom panel visible


Hi all
 
Apologies if this has already been asked but since there is no search
facility on previous posts I didn't feel like going through 15 megs
worth of posts.
 
Anyway I created my sample project (using version 3.8.1) and I wanted to
add a custom Panel to it so I followed the instructions of placing my
panel's code inside ./bin/panels
as per:
 
&quot;/bin/panels: You will see that there is a subdirectory for each panel.
Make a subdirectory for your new panel with the exact same name as your
panel and place your compiled panel code there.


Once this is accomplished, you are ready to use your panel in an
installer. Just list it in the spec file like any other panel, compile
and in theory it will show up when running the installer. Once you made
it this far, you can dig deeper and get going with your specific needs.&quot;

I then specified my panel inside my sample project install.xml file and
then proceeded to run:

../bin/compile install.xml -b . -o install.jar -k standard

I now get this:

&quot;Adding content of jar:
file:/C:/Program%20Files/IzPack/lib/standalone-compiler.j
ar!/bin/panels/LicencePanel.jar

-&gt; Fatal error :
   install.xml:61: Panel jar file not found:
.\bin\panels\InstallationSelectionP
anel.jar
com.izforge.izpack.compiler.CompilerException: install.xml:61: Panel jar
file no
t found: .\bin\panels\InstallationSelectionPanel.jar
        at
com.izforge.izpack.compiler.CompilerConfig.parseError(CompilerConfig.
java:1518)
        at
com.izforge.izpack.compiler.CompilerConfig.findIzPackResource(Compile
rConfig.java:1483)&quot;

So it looks like it's looking for my panel's jar file inside the
standalone-compiler.jar??? ( i did try putting in there and that part
worked, but I had also updated the english langpack and it moaned about
that too). I thought upon compile it was supposed to go look for these
things inside the directories themselves not that jar?

Please help...thanks

Jose Correia
