I don't think this is a huge help, but here's a few thoughts, just in 
case they do help or give you ideas.

I think you'd basically have to do that with a custom panel that knows 
which packs are database packs and can intelligently compare them, so 
if it finds pack A is selected, it knows packs B,C, &amp; D are equivalent, 
and knows which packs can be removed.  Or it can scan them based on 
phrases within the pack name, so you could name all your DB packs with 
&quot;SQL&quot; in them and make sure those 3 letters don't appear in other pack 
names, or start the names of those packs with &quot;Database: &quot;, which would 
make them easy to detect.

You can also compare allPacks with selectedPacks, so in this case, you'd 
scan selectedPacks for packs with &quot;SQL&quot; in the name and eliminate them.
