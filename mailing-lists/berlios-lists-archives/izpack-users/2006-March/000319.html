</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nice to see a new panel.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Of course, docu is real importent because not so much people means
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (as I) that the source is the best docu :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By the way, what about a separate package for custom panels of

</I>&gt;<i> com.izforge.izpack.panels

</I>&gt;<i> restricted policy for this panels. E.g. support should be possible
</I>&gt;<i> also the author is not available. Some of our current panels makes at

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But there are custom panels which makes there job for one or two

</I>&gt;<i> but I have no time (and fun) to bring them on a state which will be

</I>&gt;<i> Let us create a separate package for custom panels where we said
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;these are custom panels from IzPack users without support from the
</I>&gt;<i> IzPack developer team&quot;. Docu have to be, but in a saparate chapter.
</I>&gt;<i> My idea:
</I>&gt;<i> com.izforge.izpack.custom.panels
</I>&gt;<i> Since ~ 10 month we have com.izforge.izpack.sample. But I think
</I>&gt;<i> these type of panels are a little bit more than samples, therefore
</I>&gt;<i> an other path.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any comment?

Not that I'm an IzPack developer, but I have been working on some things 
I hope will be included soon.  I think a pack of panels like this is a 
good idea.  I currently have 4 other panels I'm working on and think at 
least 3 will be very useful to others, and plan to hang around on this 
list when I've got them done because I like the project and feel I can 
help.  I don't know whether you and others will find the panels useful, 
but the idea providing a place for such panels is good.  That way 
people that have created unique custom panels can submit them, but 
don't have to worry about supporting them or if they are something that 
will be widely used.  That'll make it easier for a lot of people to 
study sample code by non IzPack developers, as well as providing a lot 
of code that can be re-used by people making custom panels.
