In the InstallData object, which is passed to each panel when 
constructed, contains two lists, allPacks and selectedPacks.  In many 
panels, InstallData is named iData (or, also, id).  Can read the packs 
list with iData.allPacks or iData.selectedPacks.

If you want an example, and a panel you can use for troubleshooting, I 
just posted DataCheckPanel to the list yesterday, which reads all the 
InstallData variables and all the packs.  This could give you an 
example for reading the packs (both all and selected), and may well 
help you with debugging.  Just in case, I've taken the liberty of 
attaching the updated source code (fine tuned by Fabrice Mirable).

That lists the packs, and, basically, all you need to do to remove a 
pack is use the List remove() method on either allPacks or 
selectedPacks.

Hope this helps!
