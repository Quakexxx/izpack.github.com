<PRE>Hi Darren,


&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>    We've been working with IzPack and pushing it to the limits for the
</I>&gt;<i> past couple months. I will say its a great piece of work with a LOT of
</I>&gt;<i> innovative thinking in it.
</I>
Thx for that ! We're all happy to see these kind of comments from time to
time :-)

&gt;<i>Two features that we found out would be VERY
</I>&gt;<i> important (and comparatively not hard to implement) are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) An install log file that records exactly what the installer _has_
</I>&gt;<i> installed. Especially in the event it fails mid-way through.
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Put the uninstaller down first, and then allow it to work using the
</I>&gt;<i> above log. This way, partial installs can easily be uninstalled.
</I>&gt;<i> This is hugely important if an install fails and a new install will not
</I>&gt;<i> succeed over the failed one, at which point you're really stuck.
</I>
That looks like good ideas.
The first feature should be easy. To write a log containing all files
installed. Maybe a tree like view would be cool.
Something like:

pack1:
-&gt; file1
-&gt; file 2
....

pack2:
-&gt; file1
-&gt; file2

and so on...

The second feature is interesting but will be a bit more complicated to
implement.
I guess we'll need to find a nice way to catch the installation failure.
Thus, retrieve all files installed maybe from that log of feature1 and
uninstall all of them. I think we could send the data to the uninstaller
listener..
i have to check the sources.. not very familiar with this part yet.


&gt;<i> I'm happy to help with these new features too!
</I>
Any help is always welcome !
Feel free to exchange ideas, code and even better already done piece of work
:<i>-)
</I>
Each patch, fix or new feature will be tested, approved by developers and
julien and then commited to cvs for next release.

Cheers,
fabrice
