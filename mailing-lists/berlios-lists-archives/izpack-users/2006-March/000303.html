<PRE>I have a need to set whether a pack is available to be installed based
on a variable set at install time.

I have a hidden custom panel that does some system checks and determines
things about the current installation and sets a variable, let's call it
&quot;install_type&quot;.  In this case, I would like certain packs to be
preselected (and others to be completely disabled) if &quot;install_type&quot; is
set to &quot;server&quot;, and a different set of panels to be preselected (and
again, others disabled) if &quot;install_type&quot; is set to &quot;client&quot;.

I see and understand packs dependencies where one pack depends upon the
selection of another, but there doesn't appear to be a way to set a pack
to be dependent upon the value of a variable.

If that feature doesn't exist (and it appears that it doesn't) could
someone point me to the best place in the code to check for and
disable/enable and/or select/deselect a panel based on a variable value?
I know how to check a variable's value, but I'm unsure of the best place
in the code to go about trying disable/enable/select/deselect a panel on
the fly based on a variable.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
