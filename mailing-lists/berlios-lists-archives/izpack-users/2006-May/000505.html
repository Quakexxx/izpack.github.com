<PRE>Hi Hal,
may be there is an different behavior at web installations.
For this special case I have done nothing extra else I had
assumed that it uses the same base classes. 
If you has changed there something, please send the diff.

&gt;<i>And, while I'm at it, I've never used Jar files on Windows before.  Is 
</I>&gt;<i>it just me, or are then not double clickable by default?  I'm going 
</I>&gt;<i>have to add a batch file with the download for my clients 
</I>&gt;<i>since most of 
</I>&gt;<i>them get confused with right clicking or other methods that 
</I>&gt;<i>aren't just 
</I>&gt;<i>a double click to run something.  I'm also willing to bet this is a 
</I>&gt;<i>Microsoft thing connected with the Sun/Microsoft feud.
</I>
I think, I have not really understand what you mean...
The double click action will be written by an installation of a
program which handles files with that extension. May be the default
for .jar is to call a VM with -jar. I prefer winzip because more
often I must look into a jar file as execute it with -jar and
no more params :-) Therefore double click operation is not 
always the same.
For execution I prefer also a batch file.


Cheers

Klaus

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have also seen at implementation time, that bzip2 is not much

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to the point that IzPack often used for java appls which contains
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> already comprest jar files.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I'm not worried about that small an increase.  At this point, I'm 
</I>&gt;<i>concerned about a 90 MB pack
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I had played a little bit with LZMA (7zip); it was ~ 25 % better as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> deflate. But up to know I have had no time to write a filter output
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stream which compresses with LZMA.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>That's what I did for pack encryption -- I wrote another class that 
</I>&gt;<i>handles the encryption/decryption work and it only took a few lines in 
</I>&gt;<i>the packager and unpacker to call that class and wrap another 
</I>&gt;<i>io stream 
</I>&gt;<i>around the existing ones.  If a pack is not encrypted, it doesn't add 
</I>&gt;<i>the extra stream.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The java impl of LZMA self is not filter output stream orientated.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In the current design of pack compression we cannot use the 7zip
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> classes. May be it will be possible to write a wrapper around the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> classes which wrappes it to an filter output stream. LZMA will be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sometimes very slow (much slower as bzip2) at encoding...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If some one will do the work - to write an encoder as filter output
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stream and an decoder as filter input stream using
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interface com.izforge.izpack.compressor.PackCompressor
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as integration wrapper - I will be very happy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I'd be interesting in taking a look at that later, but for now 
</I>&gt;<i>I *have* 
</I>&gt;<i>to get my program so it's working and so it can be easily installed.  
</I>&gt;<i>Then I get my first break in several years and after a few 
</I>&gt;<i>days, I have 
</I>&gt;<i>to start on my last big project (I figure it'll take 2-8 weeks, 
</I>&gt;<i>depending on a few factors).  When that's done and I've had time to 
</I>&gt;<i>rest, I'll be able to look at a few other things.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Never heard of a compression which is reproducable 60% better as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> deflate. Means not only for special cases used; e.g. CCITT T.6 is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better as deflate, (can be more than 60 %) if you compress a BW image
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> without noise, but at halftone images CCITT T.6 will compress
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nothing. And an exe you cannot compress with CCITT T.6.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Will be very nice if some one can send me the sources or a link to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the description of the (non patent) algorithm.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On the other hand, it is possible that I have made a mistake at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implementation. Please look into package
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> com.izforge.izpack.compressor. There are the related classes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I'll check my figs first.  Like I said, I could have made a mistake.  
</I>&gt;<i>I'll see.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>And, while I'm at it, I've never used Jar files on Windows before.  Is 
</I>&gt;<i>it just me, or are then not double clickable by default?  I'm going
