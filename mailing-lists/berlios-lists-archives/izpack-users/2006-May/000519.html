<PRE>I've been doing some test compiles and working with pack files and the 
install.jar that IzPack creates.  I will have to make my web install 
available on my web site (obviously), and that means I will have to 
upload it to the site.  There are two packs in each install that are 
big (they are OpenOffice for Linux and Windows).  It takes about 30 
minutes to upload one of these files using scp.

To avoid unnecessary uploads, I figured I could check the MD5 sum of the 
file on my website with the MD5 sum of the file I've created.  If they 
match, I'm re-creating what I had and there's no reason to upload.  
That way I can change around packs and only have to upload the ones I 
don't alter (the uploading is an automatic script).

While experimenting with creating the install.jar file, I've found that 
even when I do NOT change a thing on the files that are included, the 
length of the file changes.  I don't see why this should happen.

What is included in the Install.jar file or the individual packs that 
would change the length?  Why is it I can create the same install 3 
different times and get 3 different file lengths?  (Once I saw the 
different file lengths, I didn't even bother to check the MD5 sums.)

I'd like to know what causes this because I may want to alter it in my 
copy of IzPack.

Thanks for any info on what might make the same install compile 
differently each time I do it.

Hal
