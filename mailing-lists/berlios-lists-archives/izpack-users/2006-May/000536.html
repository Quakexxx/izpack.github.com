<PRE>I'm trying to implement an installation that performs user input
substitution to a file contained in an ear file. 

I assumed that the executable and parsable entries are executed in the
sequence that they are defined in the pack tag; but that doesn't seem to
be the case.

In order for this to work, the executable must run to extract the
contents of the ear and ejb jar files. This works fine. The parsable
must execute after the completion of the executable so that the
variables in the ejb descriptor can be substituted by user input. Then
the final executable should run to repackage the ear file.

This approach doesn't work because the parsable runs before the first
executable completes.
I tried using the ProcessPanel to perform the jar extraction; but that
doesn't work either. I placed it before and after the pack panel.

How should this problem be solved?

Thanks in advance
Keith...
