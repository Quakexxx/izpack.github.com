<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> I think it is a good idea to have a TreePacksPanel.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Definitely, Most commercial ones have it, So why shouldn't we :)

&gt;<i> If you start developing own IzPanels see also the doco. e.g. there is 
</I>&gt;<i> a description how to integrate IzPack developing into Eclipse. 
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I'm using netbeans 5, but should be able to figure it out from the 
eclipse docs.

&gt;<i> I think it will be a panel which uses the full size. If not: I am just
</I>&gt;<i> at developing a changed handling of the layout. A common IzPanel has e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> to support different anchors and gaps. Until jet the layout of different
</I>&gt;<i> IzPanels are also different. But in future there should be one cast.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I'll try to keep the gui and layout (and functionality) the same as the 
existing panels, so that people could just change the panels tag in 
their specification, and nothing else if they want the tree. Don't know 
if tis is possible, but will try.

&gt;<i> There are two PacksPanels in the moment with some base classes. Please
</I>&gt;<i> use the base classes if possible.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>That shouldn't be a problem.

&gt;<i> I hope you can use the &lt;depends&gt;(see also the DTD) element for your tree.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Don't see why I wouldn't be able to. Shall try.

&gt;<i> We have always problems to get a docu for a new feature or panel which
</I>&gt;<i> someone of the user community has written. Fabrice tries to hold the
</I>&gt;<i> docu actual, but it is a sisyphus work. Help him and update the docu.
</I>&gt;<i> Current we use only the one under doc-ng.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>No problem. I'll document any new development I do. Also, I'll make some 
notes about stuff I've been battling with that isn't documented, or not 
documented in a way that a beginner can understand. Since starting to 
build the installer for our app, I've had to refer to this list a few times.

&gt;<i> For more discussions of developing etc. you can change to izpack-devel.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I'll do that.

Thanks for the info, I'll keep you updated on what I'm doing. I'lll 
probably have a few questions when I start developing the panel...

Cheers
Riaan
