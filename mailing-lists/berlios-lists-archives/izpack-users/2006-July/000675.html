<PRE>Hi Klaus,

Context related...

&gt;<i> may be I understand not right...
</I>I wasn't clear enough sorry...

&gt;<i> I think to add a text area is not the solution because James needs
</I>&gt;<i> the logging post mortem of the installation. In the InstallPanel the
</I>&gt;<i> current installed file will by shown in a label above the progressbar,
</I>&gt;<i> but often it is so fast that nobody can read it.
</I>
It's true that it oftens goes too fast, but once the installpanel has
finished and before clicking next, we could have a button for saving the
log. That would do the job.

&gt;<i> A text area with a
</I>&gt;<i> scroll bar will be very big (4681 lines at my server installation).
</I>&gt;<i> But I also think that it will be a good idea to duplicate install.log
</I>&gt;<i> into the file system because some user have problems to extract something
</I>&gt;<i> out of a jar file.
</I>&gt;<i> The impl should be peanuts. I vote for a facultative feature controlled
</I>&gt;<i> by an IzPack variable.
</I>
This is another nice solution. Just pick up which one ever you think is the
best. If we choose the second one then i vote for adding a checkbox on
finishpanel to open or not the log that has been created automatically by
installpanel.
If you need code i have something for it...

&gt;<i> May be we can split the work. I make the implementation, you the docu :-)
</I>&gt;<i> By the way, I write a short description of the summary stuff and send it
</I>&gt;<i> next week to you.
</I>
No problem, I'll do the docu as soon as we decided which one to use and how.

Cheers,
Fabrice
