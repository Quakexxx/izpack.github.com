There is a file search feature, but it doesn't work well -- at least in 
the configurations I've tried.  (I may have missed something there.)

As to just specifying it in xml, no, that cannot be done.  I may have 
been confused and thinking you were talking about writing a panel 
specifically.

&gt;<i> (So can I specify a 
</I>&gt;<i> PathSelectionPanel in XML? If so, where can I see the syntax? I want
</I>&gt;<i> something similar to the &quot;search&quot;, but with a text input instead of a
</I>&gt;<i> combo box and no Autodetect button).
</I>
AFAIK, the Autodetect is all that's available.  I'm working on a series 
of panels that can detect if a program within a specified version range 
is installed, but it'll be a while before it's ready.  I have a few 
more things to do on it, and even then, it's a custom panel, so it'd 
have to be added to your IzPack by hand, including all the config files 
for compiling it.  I hope to have it ready fairly soon to submit and 
see if the developers want to include it in future versions.

&gt;<i> If I can't, is there another specialised panel I can use? I know
</I>&gt;<i> about TargetPanel but that sets INSTALL_PATH. I want to set a
</I>&gt;<i> different variable.
</I>
At this point, no.  Again, the program finder I mentioned would do this, 
but it'll take some more work before it's ready for prime time.
