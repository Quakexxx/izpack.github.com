Thanks Fabrice,

Hmmm, I see what the problem is. I just noticed that the INSTALL_PATH
variable is never used in our installation. I corrected that, and now
the uninstaller is installed in our application path.

I still have an issue to deal with: we have to install our own Java
Run time when installing our application. I also want to use it to
uninstall (there is no guarantee that our clients will have a Java
installation and we can't impose it on them.

What we do now is install the jre in a ubdirectory of our application
and I want to use it to uninstall. However, when the uninstaller ends,
it leaves behind the JRE files that were in use while it was running.

I'm on WIndows and I understand it doesn't allow you to remove a file
that is being used. How can I correct this? I tried addind a &quot;del jre&quot;
after running the uninstalle but for some reason, that command is
executed before the installer is launched.

Any ideas?
