The IzPack project is running 4 mailing-lists.

You can subscribe to them [from Codehaus](http://xircles.codehaus.org/projects/izpack/lists):

* [announce](http://xircles.codehaus.org/lists/announce@izpack.codehaus.org) is a low-traffic mailing-list for announcements (e.g., releases)
* [user](http://xircles.codehaus.org/lists/user@izpack.codehaus.org) is a place for users discussions, including support
* [dev](http://xircles.codehaus.org/lists/dev@izpack.codehaus.org) is the main IzPack development channel
* [scm](http://xircles.codehaus.org/lists/scm@izpack.codehaus.org) is directly plugged on developer-oriented events such as Git commits and JIRA notifications.

The lists are also [archived on MarkMail](http://izpack.markmail.org/) and mirrored on Google Groups: [announce](http://groups.google.com/group/izpack-announce), [user](http://groups.google.com/group/izpack-user), [dev](http://groups.google.com/group/izpack-dev) and [scm](http://groups.google.com/group/izpack-scm).

We also have [an archive of the BerliOS-time lists](berlios-lists-archives/) where you may dig some useful informations.
